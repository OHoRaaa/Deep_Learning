How the hell did you get in there?\\nEllie: I...had my ways. Anyways, one of those -- what you guys call runners\\nTess: I see. Were you with Marlene when you were bitten?\\nEllie: No. I went to her for help afterwards.\\nTess: Knowing her, I\\'m surprised she didn\\'t shoot you.\\nEllie: She almost did.

Maybe they, ah, maybe they had a map or something to tell us\\nJoel: How far are we gonna take this?\\nTess: As far as it needs to go. Where was this lab of theirs?\\nEllie: She never said. She only mentioned it was someplace out west.\\nJoel: What are we doing here? This is not us.\\nTess: What do you know about us? About me?\\nJoel: I know that you are smarter than this.\\nTess: Really? Guess what, we\\'re shitty people, Joel.

Maybe we can use that.\\nJoel: Get on.\\nEllie: Really?\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: Okay, okay. Ah, be careful.\\nJoel: I gotcha.\\nJoel: I got it. Alright, let\\'s get outta here.\\nEllie: Hey, look, um...about Tess... I don\\'t even know what to--\\nJoel: Here\\'s how this thing\\'s gonna play out. You don\\'t bring up Tess -- ever.\\nEllie: Sure.\\nJoel: Repeat it.\\nEllie: What you say, goes.\\nJoel: Good. Now, there\\'s a town a few miles north of here. There\\'s a fella\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get a move on.\\nJoel: Now there we go... Yeah, it\\'ll be faster to go through here.\\nEllie: Man...\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: Nothing. It\\'s just...I\\'ve never seen anything like this, that\\'s all.\\nJoel: You mean the woods?\\nEllie: Yeah. Never walked through the woods. It\\'s kinda cool.\\nEllie: Why don\\'t you just take me back to Marlene?\\nJoel: If she was up to the task, why\\'d she drop you off on us?\\nEllie: Well, maybe she\\'s better now.\\nJoel: Kid, I don\\'t mean to upset you, but your friend\\'s chances of survival\\nEllie: She\\'s a lot tougher than you think.\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter. \\'Cause I doubt I could get either one of us back into\\nEllie: Whoa. Hey, buddy.\\nJoel: Well, shit.\\nEllie: Should we climb it?\\nJoel: No, wire on top of it. We gotta find a way to go around.\\nEllie: Whoa, look. Fireflies.

Different places.\\nEllie: You\\'ve never been here, have you?\\nJoel: I know this is where he lives, but...no, I ain\\'t never been here\\nEllie: And that smoke, you think that\\'s him?\\nJoel: Sure as hell better be.\\nEllie: Well, let\\'s go check it out then.\\nJoel: Alright, come on. Down here. Watch your step; it\\'s a good drop.\\nJoel: Are you alright?\\nEllie: I\\'m trying to learn how to whistle.\\nJoel: You don\\'t know how to whistle?\\nEllie: Well does it sound like I know how to whistle?\\nJoel: Oh, shit. It\\'s jammed from the other side.\\nEllie: Here, boost me up.\\nJoel: No, that\\'s not such a good idea.\\nEllie: Well, I can\\'t boost you up. How else are we gonna open it?\\nJoel: Alright. Gimme your foot. Now just open it. Nothing else.\\nEllie: Sure thing.\\nJoel: Careful.\\nEllie: Okay. Ah, let\\'s see. Okay. Ta-da.\\nJoel: Good job.\\nEllie: Thank you. So, let\\'s say we get a car from this buddy of yours. Then\\nJoel: Well, then we go find Tommy.\\nEllie: Marlene said he\\'s your brother.\\nJoel: And more importantly he was a Firefly. He\\'d know where to take you.\\nEllie: Oh, okay.\\nJoel: He lives far from here which is why we need the car.\\nEllie: Hey, look. Gnomes.\\nJoel: Yeah. Those are gnomes.\\nEllie: Man, I had an art book filled with these. I always thought they were\\nJoel: Alright, then.\\nEllie: Oh...look at that.\\nJoel: What, you play this before?\\nEllie: Nah. But I had a friend that knew everything about this game.\\nJoel: Well, I was never a big fan of these things.\\nEllie: I wish I could play it.\\nEllie: \"Mandatory evacuation.\" Evacuate to where?\\nJoel: Where you think? Quarantine zone. See, some places got a head\\'s up\\nEllie: Man, must be hard. Just...leaving all your stuff behind like that.\\nJoel: That ain\\'t the hard part.\\nJoel: Hmm. Yeah, that\\'s Bill\\'s handiwork.\\nEllie: Anybody else live in this town?\\nJoel: Far as I know, it\\'s just him.\\nEllie: Fireflies were everywhere, huh?\\nJoel: Yeah, they were. Hoping to restore the country to what it was.\\nEllie: Well...with a vaccine, maybe they will.\\nJoel: Maybe.\\nJoel: Jesus!\\nEllie: Whoa, Nelly. Wha--? What the hell was that?\\nJoel: That...would be one of Bill\\'s traps.\\nEllie: Your friend a bit paranoid, maybe?\\nJoel: Now that\\'s putting it lightly.\\nEllie: What\\'s the deal with this guy?\\nJoel: Well, he helped us smuggle stuff into the city. He\\'s... He knows how to\\nEllie: Well let\\'s hope we don\\'t blow up trying to find him.\\nJoel: Just watch your step. You\\'ll be fine.\\nEllie: Geez. Bill good with a bow?\\nJoel: I reckon he is.\\nJoel: Hey... Look at that.\\nEllie: Let me use that. I\\'m a pretty good shot with that thing.\\nJoel: How \\'bout we just leave this kind of stuff to me.\\nEllie: Well, we could both be armed. Cover each other.\\nJoel: I don\\'t think so.\\nJoel: Here, we can actually use this. It\\'s all clear, come on up.\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Let\\'s give this baby a whirl.\\nEllie: Oh fuck.\\nJoel: Now, listen. Bill ain\\'t exactly the most stable of individuals. So when\\nEllie: I understand.\\nJoel: We gotta be clear on this. He... He don\\'t take too kindly to strangers.\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Bill\\'s a good guy, he just definitely needs some time warming up to you,\\nJoel: See that wire? Stay underneath it okay? Just keep your head low and\\nEllie: Alright.\\nEllie: You hear that?\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nEllie: Oh, shit, you\\'re gonna go in there?\\nJoel: I wanna see what we can find.\\nEllie: You\\'re gonna find my body when I die from a heart attack.\\nJoel: Don\\'t worry. I got this.\\nEllie: Geez. That thing scared the shit outta me.\\nJoel: Well, while we\\'re here, let\\'s search the place.\\nJoel: C\\'mon, let\\'s get the hell outta here.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Shit. Look at this. Alright, stand back.\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: That\\'s one way to do it.\\nEllie: Oh, shit. Those things are kinda awesome.\\nJoel: Yeah, see that? Get back.\\nJoel: Come on. Just stay close.

This tourist got some scrap in him.\\nJoel: Alright...I think that\\'s the last of \\'em. You OK?\\nEllie: Yeah. I guess so.\\nJoel: Good, \\'cause we need to get the hell out of here. You know the drill.\\nEllie: Roger that. Agh. Hey -- maybe we can go through here.\\nJoel: Well, we sure as hell ain\\'t going back this way. Aggh...c\\'mon...Alright,\\nEllie: Um... There\\'s some pretty gnarly stuff in here.\\nJoel: Ellie!\\nEllie: Right. Okay, go.\\nJoel: Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.\\nEllie: Look.\\nJoel: Fucking hunters. See, this could\\'ve been us.\\nEllie: Man, that is a lot of people that didn\\'t make it.\\nJoel: I knew I should\\'ve turned the damn truck around.\\nEllie: We lived.\\nJoel: Barely. C\\'mon, let\\'s get outta here.\\nEllie: How did you know?\\nJoel: Know what?\\nEllie: About the ambush.\\nJoel: I\\'ve been on both sides.\\nEllie: Oh. So, ah, you kill a lot of innocent people?\\nEllie: I\\'ll take that as a yes.\\nJoel: Take it however you want.\\nEllie: I guess this is where the assholes sleep. I mean slept.\\nEllie: Oh, I don\\'t think these guys were infected.\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter. Let\\'s just keep moving.\\nJoel: Hey, Ellie, slow down. Wait for me.\\nEllie: What? I\\'m right here.\\nJoel: How \\'bout you let me go first? And keep your voice down.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nEllie: I\\'m whistling.\\nJoel: Oh, good. Something else you can annoy me with.\\nEllie: That\\'s awesome.\\nEllie: What happened here? Your fellow hunters do this?\\nJoel: Cute. And no, my money\\'s on the military.\\nEllie: Why would they mow down all these people?\\nJoel: Can\\'t let everyone in.\\nEllie: So they killed them?\\nJoel: And dead people don\\'t get infected. You sacrifice the few to save the\\nEllie: It\\'s kinda shitty.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nEllie: What was that?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know. Ellie, get down.\\nHunter: Where did you learn to shoot?\\nHunter 2: Man, screw you.\\nHunter: You had an entire flock and hit nothing.\\nHunter 2: I\\'m about to hit you.\\nHunter: Wow...yeah, you\\'re really upset. Well if you want some lessons, I\\'m\\nHunter 2: Yeah, whatever.\\nHunter 3: Where the hell are those guys? They\\'re supposed to be here.\\nHunter: They\\'re on the highway shift. Wouldn\\'t be surprised if they caught\\nHunter 3: Spot\\'s a goldmine. Lucky bastards.\\nHunter: See if there\\'s anything you can forage while we wait for them.\\nHunter 3: Ain\\'t nothin\\' here. Let\\'s keep going.\\nHunter: Screw this. I ain\\'t waiting any longer. Let\\'s go see what those\\nHunter 2: They pull this crap every time. I swear to god, if they\\'re holding\\nHunter: Yeah. And you\\'ll do what?\\nHunter 2: You\\'ll see.\\nHunter: Yeah, I will see.\\nEllie: Hey, we can climb the bus right here. Okay, we need to lighten the\\nJoel: What is that?\\nEllie: A joke book. No Pun Intended: Volume Too by Will Livingston.\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep going.\\nEllie: \"What did the Confederate soldiers use to eat off of? Civil ware.\"\\nJoel: Uh-huh.\\nEllie: \"What did they use to drink with? Cups. Dixie cups.\" \"I walked into my\\nJoel: That\\'s awful.\\nEllie: You\\'re awful.\\nJoel: Do you even understand what that means?\\nEllie: Nope. Doesn\\'t matter. Alright, I\\'m done...for now.\\nEllie: That bridge looks pretty far.\\nJoel: We\\'ll get there.\\nEllie: Whoa. It\\'s strange seeing a checkpoint with no soldiers.\\nJoel: This is what most zones look like. This place has been abandoned for a\\nEllie: \"Give us our rations.\" Why wouldn\\'t they give them their food?\\nJoel: Sometimes they ran out. Most times they just held onto it.\\nEllie: That never happened in Boston.\\nJoel: Trust me, it happened all the time.\\nEllie: I hear hunters.\\nJoel: Yeah, me too. Let\\'s keep it down while we\\'re going through this area.\\nHunter: Oh...I\\'m so fucking tired. We were up all night chasing this tourist.\\nHunter 2: Oh, you were part of that? I heard about this.\\nHunter: Yeah, this one chick, she would just not give up. I\\'ve never seen\\nHunter 2: Jesus. Sometimes you gotta earn your keep.\\nHunter: Yeah, I guess. We were about to give up when she started shooting at\\nHunter 2: Damn. Maybe you shoulda kept her. Y\\'know, made her one of us.\\nHunter: No, no way. That girl -- she\\'d a killed us all in our sleep.\\nHunter 3: Bossman says we\\'re getting big enough to expand.\\nHunter 4: New head honcho...same bullshit talk.\\nHunter 3: I don\\'t know. Now that we have enough people watching all the exits,\\nHunter 4: What is that really gonna give us?\\nHunter 3 : I don\\'t know, maybe we find some more gas, get some more generators\\nHunter 4: That shit ain\\'t happening. I\\'ve heard that expansion talk way too\\nHunter 3: How do you know? Maybe things\\'ll be different now.\\nHunter 4: Keep your expectations in check, youngun. You\\'ll live longer.\\nJoel: That was too damn close.\\nEllie: The edge of the universe and back. Endure and survive.\\nJoel: Excuse me?\\nEllie: Savage Starlight. That comic I\\'ve been reading? It\\'s what the hero says\\nJoel: Endure and survive?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Man, look at all these books. I wish I had more room in my backpack.\\nJoel: So you\\'re a reader, huh?\\nEllie: Well, when I\\'m not running away from hunters or infected? Yeah, I read\\nJoel: I get it.\\nEllie: \"A moon rock tastes better than an earthly rock...because it\\'s meteor.\"\\nJoel: Do you even get that?\\nEllie: Of course not. \"I used to be addicted to soap, but I\\'m clean now.\"\\nJoel: Alright, I\\'ve actually never heard that one.\\nEllie: That\\'s it...that\\'s all I got. Now what?\\nEllie: Man, you\\'d gotta be crazy to string up soldiers.\\nJoel: You get people desperate enough, they\\'ll do just about anything.\\nEllie: And the people that rose up...they\\'re the ones we\\'ve been fighting here?\\nJoel: That\\'d be my bet. Let\\'s see where this leads us. Watch yourself on these\\nJoel: Down, down, down, down. There\\'s more of \\'em.\\nHunter: Careful with that plank.\\nHunter 2: Let\\'s get outta here.\\nJoel: Alright. I don\\'t think they saw us.\\nEllie: Whew. There\\'s our bridge. We\\'re a little closer, I think.\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep at it. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: That girl is so skinny. I thought you had plenty of food in your time.\\nJoel: We did. Some just chose to not eat it.\\nEllie: Why the hell not?\\nJoel: For looks.\\nEllie: Pssh. That\\'s stupid.\\nEllie: I think we can use some good ol\\' pun humor. \"3.14% of sailors are pi\\nJoel: 3.14...\\nEllie: \"I stayed up all night wondering where the sun went. Then it dawned on\\nJoel: I get it.\\nEllie: \"What did the mermaid wear to her math class?\"\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: \"An algae bra.\"\\nJoel: Terrible.\\nEllie: \"Why did the scarecrow get a promotion?\"\\nJoel: Alright.\\nEllie: \"Because he was outstanding in his field.\"\\nJoel: That\\'ll do. Put that thing away.\\nEllie: Okay. I\\'m all joked out.\\nJoel: I can\\'t make that jump.\\nEllie: If you get me up there, I can move that plank.\\nJoel: Wait here! Let\\'s see where this goes.\\nJoel: What the hell? Oh, this place is bad.\\nEllie: What the hell was that all about?\\nJoel: Get on. We\\'re cuttin\\' through the hotel.\\nEllie: Um...okay...\\nJoel: Set that plank like they did.\\nEllie: Alright. Now you just need to find a way up.\\nEllie: Oh, this place stinks.\\nJoel: Yeah, wood\\'s all rotten.\\nEllie: Did you go to coffee shops a lot?\\nJoel: I did. All the time.\\nEllie: And what would you get?\\nJoel: Just...just coffee.\\nEllie: Do you think those hunters are gone?\\nJoel: We\\'re about to find out.\\nJoel: It\\'s clear, Ellie. Come on down.\\nEllie: Whoa...this is fancy. Ever stay in a place like this? Before it all\\nJoel: No...no, this is too rich for my blood.\\nEllie: Oh. I bet it was nice. I bet we can get up there.\\nJoel: No, it\\'s too high. Let\\'s see what we can find.\\nJoel: Ahhh, I really miss coffee.\\nEllie: Oh, I\\'ll be checking in for one night and I\\'d like your finest suite\\nJoel: The hell are you doin\\'?\\nEllie: Why yes, you can take my luggage upstairs.\\nJoel: You are a weird kid.\\nJoel: Come on up. Watch your step.\\nEllie: Okay, it\\'s time to lighten the mood. \"I tried to catch some fog earlier.\\nJoel: Left?\\nEllie: Yeah. That\\'s awesome. \"What does a pirate say while eating sushi?\"\\nJoel: I don\\'t know, what?\\nEllie: \"Ahoy! Pass me some soy!\" I don\\'t get it. \"People are making up\\nJoel: Oh shit. Get down, get down.\\nHunter: Grr, this tourist put up a hell of a fight. It took two of us to put\\nHunter 2: Wait, how many is that now?\\nHunter: Hmm, five just this week. But hey, I\\'m not complaining.\\nHunter 2: I bet you\\'re not. We done here?\\nHunter: We got another floor to check, man.\\nHunter 2: Check for what? I ain\\'t seen a clicker in weeks.\\nHunter: That\\'s \\'cause we\\'re thorough. We\\'re gonna keep being thorough. Now\\nHunter 2: Alright, whatever.\\nHunter 3: Hey, how \\'bout we take a little food break?\\nHunter 4: Nah, maybe in like an hour or so. We can eat something before heading\\nHunter 3: Sounds good.\\nHunter 4: Got some extra dried fruit if you want.\\nHunter 3: I\\'ll take you up on that.\\nEllie: Oh, creepy. Guess they took the easy way out, huh?\\nJoel: It ain\\'t easy -- for many it was better than letting a clicker or hunter\\nJoel: Let\\'s see where this goes.\\nEllie: Just in case.\\nJoel: It\\'s gonna be a tight fit, but come on.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: You find something to climb on. Okay, here we go.\\nEllie: Alright...\\nJoel: Here we go.\\nEllie: Oh shit! Joel! Joel!\\nJoel: I\\'m alright! Are you okay?\\nEllie: No! You scared the shit outta me! I\\'m...I\\'m gonna climb down there,\\nJoel: No! Stay up there. I\\'ll make my way up to you!\\nEllie: Don\\'t do anything stupid!\\nJoel: I\\'ll try.\\nJoel: Maybe that way. That could be it.\\nJoel: Goddamnit. I don\\'t think I tried over there yet.\\nJoel: Over there. I need to find a way around this gate. Well, maybe that\\nJoel: Oh shit.\\nJoel: I hate these things.\\nJoel: Goddammit!\\nJoel: Made it. Ah, so much for that. I gotta find Ellie.\\nHunter: It\\'s down. Finish it!\\nHunter 2: I got it.\\nHunter: Nicely done. You bit?\\nHunter 2: Not today. You?\\nHunter: Not today. Alright...spread out and make sure we didn\\'t miss any more\\nEllie: Man...I shot the hell outta that guy, huh?\\nJoel: Yeah, you sure did.\\nEllie: I feel sick.\\nJoel: Why didn\\'t you just hang back like I told you to?\\nEllie: Well, you\\'re glad I didn\\'t, right?\\nJoel: I\\'m glad I didn\\'t get my head blown off by a goddamn kid.\\nEllie: You know what? No. How about \"Hey, Ellie. I know it wasn\\'t easy, but it\\nJoel: We gotta get going.\\nEllie: Lead the way.\\nJoel: We need to get back out. Find that bridge.\\nEllie: Just tell me where to go.\\nJoel: I hate this crap.\\nEllie: Wow, look at that.\\nJoel: That\\'s a backdrop. People would take their pictures in front of it.\\nEllie: Yeah, I know what it is.\\nJoel: Okay, then. Something on your mind, Ellie?\\nEllie: I wasn\\'t trying to disobey you back there. You were taking a really\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter what you thought. I need you to listen to me.\\nEllie: I do. It\\'s just that... Whatever, Joel.\\nJoel: That door looks like a way out. Hey, you see a way to get up there?\\nEllie: Nope.\\nJoel: Might be able to get through with this. Alright... Goddamn, this is\\nEllie: You sure you can trust me with that?\\nJoel: Ellie... Push.\\nEllie: I am.\\nJoel: Push harder!\\nEllie: There. How\\'s that?\\nJoel: Let\\'s go.\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nHunter: They haven\\'t gotten back yet. What the hell\\'s taking them so long?\\nHunter 2: I don\\'t know. They went to check on \\'em. For now, we wait.\\nJoel: C\\'mere, keep your head down. Alright now...I\\'m gonna jump down there and\\nEllie: What about me?\\nJoel: You stay here.\\nEllie: This is so stupid. We\\'d have more of a fucking chance if you\\'d let me\\nJoel: I am.\\nJoel: Now you seem to know your way around a gun. You reckon you can handle\\nEllie: Well, uh, I sorta shot a rifle before...but it was a rats.\\nJoel: Rats?\\nEllie: With BBs.\\nJoel: Well, it\\'s the same basic concept. Lift it up. Alright now, you\\'re gonna\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Go ahead and pull the bolt back. Grab it right there. Just tug it. There\\nEllie: I got this.\\nJoel: Alright. And just so we\\'re clear about back there...it was either him or\\nEllie: You\\'re welcome.\\nHunter: Asshole should\\'ve known better. If you\\'re gonna steal, you better make\\nHunter 2: Right? I would\\'ve done--\\nHunter 3: They\\'re all dead! They\\'re all fucking dead!\\nHunter: The hell\\'s he yappin\\' about? Take a breath. Who\\'s dead?\\nHunter 3: The whole crew. The 76 lookout guys. Some fuckin\\' tourist killed \\'em,\\nHunter: Shit. Have you talked to the boss?\\nHunter 3: Yeah. He wants everyone to hold their ground, watch the gate.\\nHunter 2: Alright, you heard him. Search the area. Do not let anybody through!\\nHunter 4: He\\'s gotta be wrong.\\nHunter 5: About the crew being dead?\\nHunter 4: I don\\'t see some tourists taking out the entire crew.\\nHunter 5: What if they did? Maybe it\\'s the military coming back.\\nHunter 4: Don\\'t be an idiot. Military doesn\\'t give a damn about this place.\\nHunter 5: We\\'ll find them. We always do.\\nHunter 4: I hope you\\'re right.\\nJoel: Alright, come on down.\\nEllie: How\\'d I do?\\nJoel: How \\'bout something a...little more your size.\\nJoel: It\\'s for emergencies only.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Now, the safety\\'s on. Do you know how to switch it off?\\nEllie: I do.\\nJoel: Okay, you just...you gotta respect it. This is not--\\nEllie: Joel, I\\'ll be careful.\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Whoa, nelly. Harsh punishment.\\nJoel: Shit. It ain\\'t that much different from what the military does back in\\nEllie: I guess not.\\nJoel: Alright, do your thing, Ellie.\\nEllie: On it. Come on. Stupid chain is stuck. Hold on.\\nJoel: I am.\\nEllie: There.\\nJoel: That\\'s good thinkin\\'.\\nEllie: How \\'bout you get me up there?\\nJoel: Help me open this.\\nEllie: Here.\\nJoel: I got it.\\nVoice: Run!\\nJoel: Oh shit, get down, get down.\\nVoice: Keep running!\\nEllie: What do we do?\\nJoel: Nothing.\\nDying Woman: No...\\nHunter: Busy couple a days, huh?\\nHunter 2: Whatever, man. Damn. No food, old pair of shoes. They got nothin\\'.\\nHunter: Alright.\\nEllie: Oh man...\\nJoel: There ain\\'t nothin\\' we coulda done.\\nEllie: I know...it\\'s just...oh man.\\nJoel: Let\\'s just get to that bridge.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nHunter: Well, at least they finally killed that couple. I was sure they made\\nHunter 2: There better\\'ve been an army in that truck. How the fuck did they\\nHunter: Let\\'s keep searching. I wanna wrap this up by sundown.\\nHunter: Got word from the east side crew -- they ain\\'t seen shit.\\nHunter 2: What about Market Street?\\nHunter: Yeah, they\\'re driving through that area now. Who knows, maybe they\\'ll\\nHunter 2: I pray to god these tourists show their faces.\\nHunter: Fuck, they gotta show up somewhere...I think this\\'ll be your lucky day.\\nEllie: Joel, there\\'s a guy up on that second floor, right there.\\nJoel: Yeah, I see him. Stay low.\\nEllie: Oh man. Endure and survive.\\nJoel: What? Oh, right...the comic book thing.\\nEllie: Geez. I guess this is how it ended for this zone.\\nJoel: Well, every battle\\'s got a losing side.\\nEllie: What if they had families?\\nJoel: Everyone has a family. Best not to dwell on it.\\nEllie: How can you not? Hey -- get me up there. Come on.\\nJoel: There ya go.\\nJoel: We\\'re almost there.\\nEllie: I stayed at a place like this. Back in the Boston QZ.\\nJoel: \"Military Preparatory School\".\\nEllie: Yeah, nice way of saying orphanage. I wonder what happened to all these\\nJoel: This place has been out for a good stretch. They ain\\'t kids no more.\\nEllie: Meaning they\\'re either hunters trying to kill us, or they\\'re dead.\\nJoel: Or they got away.\\nEllie: But you don\\'t believe that?\\nJoel: I believe in getting out of this city. Come on.\\nEllie: There\\'s another one.\\nEllie: These posters are everywhere.\\nJoel: I saw this right before the outbreak.\\nEllie: You did? Did he totally gut her by the end?\\nJoel: Nobody gets gutted. It\\'s a dumb teen movie.\\nEllie: Who dragged you to see it then?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know. Let\\'s just stay focused, alright?\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get through the alley.\\nEllie: Agh, it\\'s that fucking truck.\\nJoel: It\\'s alright, keep your head down.\\nHunter: Six.\\nHunter 2: Nope.\\nHunter: Seven.\\nHunter 2: Not even close.\\nHunter: Ten.\\nHunter 2: Keep going.\\nHunter: I don\\'t know, twenty.\\nHunter 2: Try twenty-five.\\nHunter: Bullshit.\\nHunter 2: Swear to god.\\nHunter: You have twenty-five cans of bacon?\\nHunter 2: Well, twenty-four. I just finished one.\\nHunter: How the hell do you have twenty-four cans of bacon?\\nHunter 2: Military locker in the hotel, from back in the day. Me and Reuben\\nHunter: And that shit\\'s still good? When are you making some more?\\nHunter 2: Why?\\nHunter: Why do you think? I want some.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, I bet you do.\\nHunter: Man...I saved your ass from that clicker last week.\\nHunter 2: I\\'ll think about it.\\nHunter: I shoulda let your ass die back there.\\nHunter 2: Oh, Jesus. I\\'ll make you some if you quit bringing that up.\\nHunter: It better be as good as you say it is.\\nHunter 2: It\\'s bacon; of course it\\'s good.\\nEllie: What the fuck are they shooting at us with?\\nJoel: I think we lost \\'em.\\nEllie: Oh shit.\\nJoel: We\\'re okay. They can\\'t see us.\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nMan: What the fuck?\\nJoel: Sonofa--\\nEllie: Joel.\\nMan: Wait. Wait!\\nEllie: Joel, stop! Look.\\nMan: Leave him alone.\\nJoel: Easy, on. Just take it easy.\\nMan: It\\'s alright. They\\'re not the bad guys. Lower the gun. Man, you hit hard.\\nJoel: Yeah, well, I was trying to kill you.\\nMan: Yeah, I thought you were one of them too. Then I saw you. If you haven\\'t\\nKid: You\\'re bleeding.\\nMan: Ah, it\\'s nothing.\\nHenry: I\\'m Henry. This is Sam. I think I caught your name was Joel?\\nEllie: Ellie.\\nJoel: How many are with you?\\nSam: They\\'re all dead.\\nHenry: Hey, we don\\'t know that. There were a bunch of us. Someone had the\\nEllie: We can help each other.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: Safety in numbers and all that.\\nHenry: She\\'s right. We could help each other. We got a hideout not too far\\nJoel: Alright, take us there.\\nHenry: Follow me.\\nSam: Sorry about the whole gun thing.\\nEllie: Don\\'t worry. I would\\'ve probably done the same thing. Where you from?\\nSam: All the way from Hartford.\\nEllie: Really? I heard some bad stuff going on down there.\\nSam: Yeah, the military abandoned the zone. It\\'s why we left. Place probably\\nHenry: We gotta be careful. We\\'re right next to one of their lookout areas. Is\\nEllie: We\\'re not related, we\\'re more like, um...\\nJoel: I promised someone I\\'d look after her.\\nHenry: Yeah, I can appreciate that.\\nHenry: Wait, wait. Everyone be quiet. Get away from the windows.\\nJoel: They\\'re gone.\\nHenry: Man...that fuckin\\' truck. It\\'s been hounding us ever since we got in\\nSam: Nothing.\\nHenry: Get rid of it.\\nSam: My backpack is practically empty.\\nHenry: What\\'s the rule about takin\\' stuff?\\nSam: It weighs like nothing.\\nHenry: The rule -- what is it?\\nSam: We only take what we have to.\\nHenry: That\\'s right. Now come on.\\nJoel: How far is this place?\\nHenry: We\\'re close. Real close.\\nJoel: Shit. Ellie, you watch our back.\\nEllie: Of course.\\nHenry: Sam, stay with her.\\nHunter: What\\'d you find?\\nHunter 2: Nothing... Looks like someone was up there, but they\\'re long gone.\\nHunter: So where are the others?\\nHunter 2: They wanted to give it another once over. Make sure we didn\\'t miss\\nHunter: Alright...keep an eye out over there. I\\'ll check this area.\\nHenry: We did it. Not bad, old timer. Come on, up on this truck. Oh shit,\\nHenry: Through this door.\\nJoel: Are you sure it\\'s safe being so close to them?\\nHenry: I\\'m the only one with the key, man.\\nJoel: And where\\'d you get that?\\nHenry: I killed one of \\'em. He won\\'t miss it now. Everybody through.\\nSam: It\\'s back here. So...how old are you?\\nEllie: Me? Fourteen. How old are you?\\nSam: Ah...the same.\\nHenry: Oh, you\\'re fourteen, huh?\\nSam: I\\'m close.\\nHenry: Alright.\\nSam: I am.\\nHenry: Here we are. Welcome to my office.\\nEllie: How long have you guys been holed up in here?\\nSam: A few days. We found a bit of food, though. Here.\\nHenry: Blueberries. Found a whole stash of \\'em. You want some?\\nJoel: No.\\nHenry: Hey, man, relax. We\\'re safe.\\nJoel: So why haven\\'t you left?\\nHenry: Been waiting for the right opportunity.\\nJoel: And?\\nHenry: Here. Check this out.\\nHenry: Look at these sons of bitches. Everyday they congregate down there,\\nJoel: That could work.\\nHenry: Oh, it\\'ll work. It\\'ll definitely work. Wow...\\nSam: Ready?\\nEllie: Ow.\\nSam: A blueberry hurt you?\\nHenry: It\\'s been awhile since that boy even cracked a smile. She doesn\\'t seem\\nJoel: So where were you headin\\'?\\nHenry: Heard the Fireflies are based out west somewhere. We\\'re gonna join up\\nJoel: Yeah...\\nHenry: Somethin\\' funny?\\nJoel: Just seems like there\\'s a lot of people putting their stock on the\\nHenry: Yeah, maybe there\\'s a reason for that.\\nJoel: So you don\\'t know where they are and you\\'re just gonna drag him across\\nHenry: I tell you what, how about I worry about my brother and you worry about\\nJoel: Easy. We\\'re looking for the Fireflies too.\\nHenry: This is us. There\\'s an abandoned military radio station, just outside\\nJoel: I guess we best rest up then.\\nEllie: He says it\\'s time to go.\\nHenry: Now, we\\'re gonna be moving fast, okay? So no matter what, you stick to\\nSam: Like glue. Got it.\\nHenry: Like glue. Good, good. Alright, y\\'all ready?\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nHenry: Okay. Alright, y\\'all stay close, okay?\\nJoel: You tried this before?\\nHenry: Uh, yeah.\\nJoel: That\\'s comforting.\\nHenry: Relax, old man.\\nJoel: I just hope you know the way.\\nHenry: This way.\\nHenry: Okay, let\\'s try to take them out quietly. Hey, I\\'ll follow your lead.\\nJoel: Alright.\\nHunter: Hey...how you doing?\\nHunter 2: Just trying to keep warm. How\\'s it looking out there?\\nHunter: We put down some infected, but no sign of those tourists.\\nHunter 2: Think they\\'re still in the city?\\nHunter: Yeah, they\\'re still around. Alright...I\\'m gonna do another round.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, you too.\\nHunter: Hey, you hear that? Clicker.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, I hear it, but I don\\'t see shit! Woo! Nailed it! Did you see\\nHunter: Not bad. Hold up, there it is!

How the fuck do we get outta here?\\nHunter: The hell is going on back there?\\nHunter 2: Sounds like they found \\'em. Spread out. They might come through here.\\nJoel: Alright, let\\'s get underneath it.\\nHunter: Fuckin\\' open it! Go! There! They\\'re running to the bridge! Go, go, go!\\nEllie: Joel!\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nEllie: Oh, fuck.\\nJoel: How many bullets do you have left?\\nEllie: They\\'re gonna kill us.\\nJoel: What other choice do we have?\\nEllie: We jump.\\nJoel: No, it\\'s too high and you can\\'t swim. I\\'ll boost you up, you run past\\nEllie: Oh, shit.\\nJoel: Oh my god.\\nEllie: You\\'ll keep me afloat.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: No time to argue.\\nJoel: Ellie!

He\\'s pissed but he\\'s not gonna do\\nJoel: You sure about that?\\nSam: Stop!\\nEllie: Joel.\\nJoel: He left us to die out there.\\nHenry: No. You had a good chance of making it, and you did. But coming back\\nEllie: He saved me too. We woulda drowned.\\nHenry: It\\'s fine though. I\\'m okay. Y\\'know, for what it\\'s worth, I\\'m really\\nEllie: That was intense. You cool?\\nJoel: Yeah. Let\\'s go find that radio tower.\\nEllie: For a second there, I thought you might shoot him.\\nJoel: Yeah...almost did.\\nEllie: They\\'re alright. I think it\\'s good to have \\'em around.\\nJoel: I think you\\'re right.\\nSam: Um, do you trust him?\\nHenry: Yeah, I do. Hey, don\\'t worry about it. We\\'re fine now, okay?\\nSam: Yeah.\\nHenry: You gotta believe me on this, Sam, alright?\\nSam: Sure.\\nEllie: Hey, maybe we can find something in that boat over there.\\nHenry: Keep your eyes peeled!\\nJoel: Way ahead of you, kid.\\nEllie: Whoa.\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: First time on a boat.\\nJoel: Well, it\\'s a little bit different in the water.\\nEllie: One step at a time.\\nSam: Hey, Ellie. I think we found something!\\nEllie: Let\\'s go see what it is.\\nHenry: Hey, I bet this goes all the way through. Gimme a hand with this.\\nJoel: Alright, same time. Come on.\\nHenry: Let\\'s do it.\\nJoel: Alright, c\\'mon, kids, go.\\nHenry: Alright. Here we go.\\nJoel: You go in.\\nHenry: Okay.\\nHenry: Hey, flashlights out.

Gotta find a different way.\\nEllie: Joel, we should see what\\'s over here.\\nJoel: It\\'s blocked.\\nEllie: If you can get it open, I can crawl through and clear that door. Oh,\\nEllie: Do you think they\\'ll join us all the way to Tommy\\'s?\\nJoel: Well, I don\\'t know. We\\'re just gonna have to see how everything pans out.\\nHenry: This way. Yeah, looks like there\\'s a path up ahead. Right here.\\nSam: Can we get out this way?\\nSam: Well, I can\\'t swim.\\nEllie: That makes two of us.\\nHenry: Alright, Joel, how do we get across?\\nJoel: Guess we gotta figure somethin\\' out.\\nHenry: Hey, this thing\\'s on some kinda track. Maybe there\\'s a way we can use\\nEllie: Look, a generator.\\nHenry: It\\'s jammed!\\nJoel: Henry, give it a shot!\\nHenry: Alright! Here we go. Yep -- it\\'s working!\\nJoel: I\\'ll go have a look. You keep an eye out.\\nHenry: Joel! You okay?\\nJoel: Yeah! Still in one piece.\\nEllie: Oh -- this thing again.\\nHenry: Oh, there you go. That\\'s smart.\\nEllie: Ahh, I can\\'t wait to get outta this place.\\nJoel: Alright, see if that generator\\'s still got some juice.\\nEllie: Here goes nothin\\'. Alright!\\nSam: Huh. I can\\'t believe that actually worked.\\nHenry: Yeah, don\\'t jinx us.\\nHenry: I gotta say, I\\'m impressed with you two.\\nEllie: Pssh...we\\'re pros at this by now.\\nEllie: Uh...what\\'s up with this?\\nSam: You think there\\'s people inside?\\nHenry: Maybe.\\nEllie: Are we really going in there?\\nJoel: Oh shit.\\nHenry: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\nSam: It\\'s a sound trap.\\nEllie: A what?\\nJoel: It\\'s a sort of alarm.\\nEllie: I don\\'t hear anything.\\nJoel: Someone used to live here. Don\\'t look like that\\'s the case anymore.\\nSam: Who would stay in here?\\nHenry: Well, someone who thought they could keep a place like this safe.\\nJoel: Ugh.\\nEllie: Oh, awesome.\\nJoel: Ellie, don\\'t--\\nEllie: Ah, calm down. Sam, stand by those posts over there. Yeah.\\nSam: Okay.\\nEllie: Ready?\\nSam: Oh, Henry, did you see that?\\nHenry: Let\\'s keep it down, buddy, okay?\\nSam: Yeah. Sorry.\\nEllie: You hear that? Infected.\\nJoel: Shh, shhh. Quiet.\\nHenry: There\\'s three more heading our way!\\nEllie: Well, I guess we know what happened to these people.\\nJoel: Seeing as how there was a clicker, they must\\'ve been gone for awhile.\\nHenry: We keep moving forward. All we can do is hope that there aren\\'t any\\nEllie: Hey. You think that leads out?\\nHenry: Could be. It\\'s too high for a boost. Maybe there\\'s another way to get\\nJoel: Oh shit. Get back!\\nEllie: What?\\nHenry: Sam!\\nSam: Yeah, I\\'m cool.\\nJoel: That was me. I must\\'ve triggered some sort of safety gate or somethin\\'.\\nEllie: So...this is awkward.\\nSam: Yeah, I know. It\\'s like every time--\\nEllie: Clickers!\\nJoel: What?\\nHenry: Hey, this thing isn\\'t budging, man.\\nJoel: Just go, get outta here.\\nHenry: Sam, you stay close to him.\\nEllie: Henry, we gotta fucking move!\\nHenry: You keep him safe!\\nJoel: Go! Shh, shh, shh.\\nJoel: We\\'re gonna be fine.\\nHenry: Yeah, yeah I know.\\nJoel: Alright, come on, kid. See if we can find a way outta here, yeah?\\nHenry: Okay.\\nSam: You did it.\\nJoel: We\\'re gonna keep going. You good?\\nSam: Yeah. I bet there were a lot of them here. People, I mean.\\nJoel: Looks like it.\\nSam: Look at this place. It\\'s like a classroom. Why couldn\\'t they keep it safe?\\nJoel: Son, I wish I knew. God knows they didn\\'t deserve it. You think you can\\nSam: Yeah.\\nJoel: Go ahead.\\nSam: There we go.\\nJoel: Good job, kid.\\nEllie: Fucking thing!\\nSam: Is that Ellie?\\nJoel: C\\'mon.\\nSam: Joel, that\\'s them.\\nHenry: Sam!\\nEllie: Oh thank god. We gotta keep running.\\nHenry: Doorway -- over there! Sam!\\nEllie: Run! There\\'s too many of \\'em!\\nJoel: Ellie! Get away from the door!\\nHenry: Maybe if we push it together.\\nEllie: Sam! He just crawled through!\\nHenry: He what? Sam, what the hell are you doin\\'?\\nSam: Getting us outta here!\\nHenry: Well, hurry up then!\\nJoel: Alright, go.\\nHenry: Everyone, upstairs. Let\\'s go!\\nHenry: Damn thing\\'s stuck!\\nEllie: Gimme a boost! I can get through that window.\\nHenry: Open it from the other side.\\nJoel: Make it fast!\\nHenry: C\\'mon, Sam, you\\'re not staying in here.\\nSam: What about you?\\nHenry: I\\'ll be fine. C\\'mon. Go.\\nJoel: Get ready!\\nHenry: Fuck. Here we go!\\nEllie: We got it!\\nJoel: Alright, move! Let\\'s go, let\\'s go!\\nHenry: Fresh air...\\nJoel: Oh...\\nEllie: Wha--\\nSam: Look at this.\\nEllie: Oh, are you fucking kidding me? Thanks for the warning on the other\\nJoel: So, where\\'s this tower?\\nHenry: We\\'re close. C\\'mon, let\\'s go. Hey. How you doin\\', little man?\\nSam: That was a close one, huh?\\nHenry: Yeah. Not one of our finest moments, but we made it out.\\nSam: Yeah.\\nHenry: Hey, look at that. Yep, what\\'d I tell you, huh?\\nJoel: Let\\'s find a way around to it. What about you, how you holdin\\' up?\\nEllie: Business as usual, right? When I was with Henry, I took out a couple of\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nSam: It was pretty intense back there, huh?\\nEllie: Yeah. Totally.\\nSam: How\\'d you two end up together?\\nEllie: Oh...a friend of mine, Marlene, asked him to take me to the Fireflies.\\nSam: You seem to get along well.\\nEllie: Yeah, well...now I just boss him around. Isn\\'t that right, Joel?\\nEllie: What was this place like without infected? Tsh...I can\\'t even imagine\\nSam: \"Will shoot on sight.\" Lots of friendly people lived here.\\nHenry: First few months after the outbreak, they had a lot of lootin\\'.\\nJoel: Everyone barricaded themselves in their homes, then supplies started\\nHenry: I was just five when the cordyceps hit. My memory\\'s pretty hazy, but I\\nEllie: What do you remember?\\nHenry: Uhh...barbecues. Parents, they would throw these crazy big barbecues\\nEllie: Oh. Doggies.\\nJoel: You\\'re gonna want to stay away from those. It\\'s not like it is in the\\nEllie: What is this?\\nSam: Oh, this is an ice cream truck.\\nEllie: An ice cream truck?\\nSam: Yeah, Henry told me about these. They\\'d sell ice cream out of the truck.\\nEllie: What? No way. Joel?\\nJoel: It\\'s true. This thing would drive around and play real loud, creepy\\nEllie: You\\'re totally fucking with me.\\nJoel: Um-mmm. Serious.\\nEllie: Man, you lived in a strange time.\\nSam: Told you so.\\nEllie: Agghh...is anybody else hungry?\\nSam: Yes.\\nHenry: Hey guys -- we break when we get to the radio tower.\\nSam: Alright.\\nSam: Darts.\\nEllie: Right.\\nHenry: Hey, Sam...be careful.\\nSam: Yeah...okay. Alright, I\\'ll go first. Damn it.\\nEllie: Oh.\\nSam: Alright, your turn.\\nEllie: Okay. Just throw it?\\nSam: Yeah.\\nEllie: Boosh, I am a natural.\\nSam: Luck.\\nEllie: No it wasn\\'t.\\nSam: That was luck.\\nEllie: Alright, get outta here. You\\'re getting cocky. Here we go. Fuck.\\nSam: Horrible.\\nEllie: Alright...it\\'s a tie.\\nSam: No, no, you clearly got destroyed.\\nEllie: How did I clearly get destroyed? That\\'s practically a tie!\\nSam: Yeah, okay.\\nHenry: There\\'ll come a day when kids can just be kids again.\\nJoel: Let\\'s go.\\nHenry: Fireflies were here.\\nJoel: Yeah, by the looks of it.\\nSam: How\\'re we gonna find them?\\nJoel: I know a guy. My brother, actually. He was a Firefly. Last I heard he\\nHenry: Sounds like a good plan, man.\\nEllie: Ah, okay. You guys are killing me with your downer talk. It\\'s joke\\nSam: What is that?\\nEllie: Just bear with me. \"You wanna hear a joke about pizza? Never mind, it\\nSam: I don\\'t get it.\\nEllie: Yeah, me neither. \"What did the green grape say to purple grape?\\nSam: That\\'s so stupid. Alright, I got a joke for you.\\nEllie: Let\\'s hear it.\\nSam: Why can\\'t your nose be twelve inches long?\\nEllie: I don\\'t know, why?\\nSam: Because...then it would be a foot.\\nEllie: That\\'s so dumb. I love it.\\nJoel: Oh shit! Get down.\\nEllie: Oh shit...\\nHenry: Fuckin\\' sniper... Did you see where it came from?\\nJoel: Somewhere down the street. Alright now...y\\'all stay here.\\nEllie: No.\\nJoel: Before you start -- I need you guys to keep him busy. I\\'m gonna go\\nEllie: Okay. Hey. Be careful.\\nJoel: Come on, guys... Oh, no, no, no.\\nHunter: It\\'s those damn tourists from the city.\\nJoel: Come on, Henry.\\nHunter 2: Thought you could get away from us, huh?\\nHunter: We\\'re back, motherfucker!\\nEllie: Shit! Oh, that was so intense!\\nHenry: You alright Sam?\\nSam: Yeah, I\\'m okay.\\nEllie: Thanks, Joel.\\nHenry: Alright. We did it.\\nEllie: We should move.\\nSam: Henry!\\nJoel: Shit.\\nHenry: Sam, are you okay?\\nSam: Yeah. Yeah, I\\'m fine.\\nHenry: You sure? You seem funny.\\nEllie: C\\'mon, c\\'mon.\\nHenry: Let\\'s move!\\nJoel: Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh god...\\nEllie: Joel, you\\'re okay.\\nJoel: Still here. Anybody hurt?\\nSam: Uh-uh.\\nHenry: No, we\\'re good.\\nJoel: Alright, I think it\\'s time we quit this place. C\\'mon.\\nHenry: Let\\'s go.\\nHenry: Shut the hell up.\\nJoel: Dead serious. It was Tommy\\'s birthday. That\\'s all he wanted to do is\\nHenry: Ah, man. I could die happy if I could just drive one around the block.\\nJoel: It was good. It was real good.\\nHenry: Good? Can you believe this guy? C\\'mon, man, gimme details. Describe it.\\nEllie: You know what? You two deserve a little privacy.\\nHenry: No, no, Ellie, Ellie, this isn\\'t just any regular motorcycle, okay? You\\nEllie: Oh yeah? How would you know?\\nHenry: I\\'ve seen it in my dreams... Vroom, vroom, vroom...\\nEllie: Okay.\\nHenry: I don\\'t think anyone from our group\\'s gonna show up.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nHenry: Worst part about it all -- explaining it to Sam.\\nEllie: Well, it\\'s safe to say those two have officially bonded. What\\'re you\\nSam: Taking stock of all the food we found today.\\nEllie: I see... And how are we doing on canned peaches?\\nSam: Did Henry send you?\\nEllie: No. Why would Henry send me?\\nSam: To make sure I\\'m not fucking up somehow.\\nEllie: Psshhh. I\\'d say we all did pretty good back there -- especially you.\\nSam: Well...\\nEllie: Is everything alright?\\nSam: Everything\\'s fine.\\nEllie: Okay... Well... Have a good night.\\nSam: How is it that you\\'re never scared?\\nEllie: Who says that I\\'m not?\\nSam: What\\'re you scared of?\\nEllie: Let\\'s see...scorpions are pretty creepy. Um...being by myself. I\\'m\\nSam: Those things out there. What if the people are still inside? What if\\nEllie: Okay, first of all, we\\'re a team now. We\\'re gonna help each other out.\\nSam: Henry says that, \"they\\'ve moved on\". That they\\'re with their families.\\nEllie: I go back and forth. I mean, I\\'d like to believe it.\\nSam: But you don\\'t.\\nEllie: I guess not.\\nSam: Yeah...me neither.\\nEllie: Oh...all this serious talk, I almost forgot.\\nEllie: There. If he doesn\\'t know about it, he can\\'t take it away. Alright, I\\'m\\nEllie: Damn. That smells good.\\nJoel: Good morning.\\nEllie: Where\\'s Sam?\\nHenry: I let him sleep in for once.\\nEllie: Oh.\\nHenry: Well if you want him to join us, you can go wake his ass up.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nEllie: Sam? Sam!\\nJoel: What the hell?\\nJoel: Shit! He\\'s turnin\\'!\\nHenry: That\\'s my fucking brother!\\nEllie: Sam!\\nJoel: Screw it!\\nEllie: Oh, shit...\\nJoel: Ellie? Ellie, are you alright?\\nEllie: Uh-huh. Oh my god.\\nHenry: Sam?\\nEllie: Oh no...\\nHenry: Sam...\\nJoel: Henry. Ellie, stay here. Henry.\\nHenry: Henry, what have you done?\\nJoel: I\\'m gonna get that gun from you, okay?\\nHenry: Sa...Sa...Sam...\\nJoel: Whoa. Okay, okay, easy.\\nHenry: It\\'s your fault.\\nJoel: This is nobody\\'s fault, Henry.\\nHenry: It\\'s all your fault!\\nJoel: Henry! Henry, no...\\nEllie: Oh my god.\\nEllie: Jackson County. That means we\\'re close to Jackson City, right?\\nJoel: Shouldn\\'t be more than a few miles.\\nEllie: You ready to see your dear old brother?\\nJoel: I\\'m just ready to get there.\\nEllie: You nervous?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know what I\\'m feeling.\\nEllie: So much for this road.\\nJoel: We just follow the river. It\\'ll lead us straight to Tommy\\'s. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: What happened between you two?\\nJoel: What do you mean?\\nEllie: You and Tommy...you\\'re not together, so clearly something went down.\\nJoel: We just had a bit of a disagreement, that\\'s all.\\nEllie: Oh, here we go...so what was it about?\\nJoel: Tommy saw the world one way, I saw it the other.\\nEllie: And that\\'s why he joined the Fireflies?\\nJoel: Yeah, your friend Marlene promised him hope. That kept him busy for\\nEllie: How was it, the last time you saw him?\\nJoel: I believe his last words to me were \"I don\\'t ever want to see your god\\nEllie: Geez. But he\\'s gonna help us?\\nJoel: I suppose we\\'re gonna find out.\\nEllie: Well, with or without his help, we\\'ll get there.\\nJoel: Let\\'s just keep going.\\nEllie: Whoa, what\\'s that?\\nJoel: That there is a hydroelectric power plant.\\nEllie: A...hydra who?\\nJoel: It, uh...uses the river\\'s movement and turns it into electricity.\\nEllie: How\\'s it do that?\\nJoel: Look. I know what it is, I don\\'t know how it does it.\\nEllie: Alright...how are we getting across?\\nEllie: Well, that gets us halfway. If we get the other one up, we\\'ll make it\\nJoel: Alright, Ellie, I need you to--\\nEllie: I know, step on the fucking pallet.\\nJoel: Go on, give it a spin.\\nEllie: Hey, be careful crossing that thing.\\nJoel: I will.\\nEllie: Teamwork.\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: That\\'s too small of a grave.\\nEllie: I forgot to leave that stupid robot on his grave. What should I do with\\nJoel: Ellie...\\nEllie: What? I want to talk about it.\\nJoel: No.\\nEllie: Why not?\\nJoel: How many times do we need to go over this? Things happen...and we move\\nEllie: It\\'s just--\\nJoel: That\\'s enough.\\nEllie: You\\'re right. I\\'m sorry.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get to Tommy\\'s.\\nEllie: Aughh, I\\'m so hungry.\\nJoel: I know, I am too.\\nEllie: Alright, next squirrel I see, I\\'m totally shooting it.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get past this place, then we can scrounge up some food.\\nEllie: Well, if I starve, you\\'re responsible.\\nEllie: Uh...should we head in?\\nJoel: Ah, ain\\'t no way around... Gonna have to cut through the plant.\\nWoman: Don\\'t even think about reaching for your weapon. Tell the girl to drop\\nJoel: Ellie, do as the lady says.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nWoman: Please tell me you\\'re lost.\\nJoel: We didn\\'t know the place was occupied. We\\'re just trying to make our way\\nWoman: Through to where?\\nVoice: They\\'re alright.\\nWoman: What, you know these people?\\nVoice: I know him.\\nTommy: He\\'s my goddamn brother.\\nJoel: Tommy.\\nTommy: Holy shit.\\nJoel: How you doin\\', baby brother?\\nTommy: Goddamn.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nTommy: Let me look at you. You got fucking old.\\nJoel: Easy -- it\\'s gonna happen to you too.\\nTommy: This is Maria. Be nice to her, she sorta runs things around here.\\nJoel: Ma\\'am. Thanks for not blowing my head off.\\nMaria: Would\\'ve been embarrassing, considering you\\'re my brother-in-law.\\nTommy: We all gotta get wrangled up at some point.\\nMaria: Ellie, right?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nMaria: What brings you through here?\\nEllie: Uh...it\\'s kind of a long story.\\nTommy: Why don\\'t we bring \\'em inside?\\nMaria: Yeah. You hungry?\\nEllie: Starving.\\nMaria: False alarm. They\\'re friendlies. We\\'ve been dealing with raids. Lot of\\nTommy: It\\'s been quiet for a few days.\\nJoel: What the hell are you doin\\' here? I thought I\\'d find you in Jackson.\\nTommy: Been trying to bring the plant back to life.\\nMaria: We had it working before, but one of the turbines went south.\\nTommy: We have electricity, Joel...had. We\\'ll get it running again.\\nEllie: No way. You guys have horses.\\nTommy: We got a whole lot of \\'em.\\nMan: Hey, Tommy, gimme a hand with this.\\nTommy: Sorry. I\\'ll be right back.\\nEllie: Can I?\\nMaria: Yeah, of course. He likes when you pet his ears. You ever ride one?\\nEllie: I actually have.\\nJoel: When have you ridden a horse?\\nEllie: Winston, this soldier back in the zone. He gave me lessons.\\nMaria: You know, if you want, we can take him riding later.\\nEllie: That\\'d be awesome.\\nTommy: There!\\nMan: Hey thanks, Tommy.\\nTommy: No sweat. All right, let\\'s continue the tour.\\nMaria: Earl?\\nEarl: Yeah?\\nMaria: Why are you here? Weren\\'t you supposed to head back this morning?\\nEarl: Still waiting on Houser and the rest of the boys to relieve me.\\nMaria: We\\'ll be fine.

Let\\'s give the boys some space. I\\'m sending Tommy over.\\nTommy: This\\'ll be the sixth time of them trying to get the turbines back\\nTommy: It\\'s a little faded but it still looks pretty good.\\nJoel: I\\'m good.\\nTommy: You sure? I mean...\\nJoel: I said I\\'m good.\\nTommy: Okay. Well, I\\'ll hold onto it for you.\\nJoel: Tommy, I...I need to talk to you. Privately.\\nTommy: Yeah, okay.

Been at it for too long to give up now.\\nWoman: You\\'re new around here.\\nJoel: Yeah, Joel. I\\'m Tommy\\'s--\\nWoman: Brother. Word travels quickly around these parts.\\nJoel: Apparently.\\nWoman: I kind of see the resemblance.\\nJoel: I see.\\nWoman: It\\'s a compliment.\\nJoel: It\\'s a pleasure meeting you.\\nWoman: You too.\\nJoel: What do you do for protection?\\nTommy: The adults take turns guarding the perimeter. We even got an\\nJoel: You still gotta deal with those infected though, right?\\nTommy: Who doesn\\'t? But that\\'s the world we live in.\\nJoel: Well, maybe you don\\'t have to be.\\nTommy: You sound like Marlene.\\nTommy: These two geniuses are gonna bring this plant back to life.\\nMan: We think we got it this time.\\nMan 2: You don\\'t believe us?\\nTommy: I didn\\'t say that.\\nMan: I bet you a million bucks it works.\\nTommy: Sure. Make it two.\\nMan 2: We\\'re almost ready. They just need to finish putting the shield back on.\\nTommy: No rush.\\nMan 3: To the left! Watch it!\\nMan 4: Okay, that\\'s good. Lower it.

Looks like you\\'re out two million bucks.\\nTommy: Alright, Joel. Let\\'s go talk.\\nJoel: That\\'s quite the crew you got here.\\nTommy: They\\'re good men. This place gives \\'em a second chance. It gives us all\\nJoel: I\\'ve been on quite the adventure, little brother.\\nTommy: I reckon it\\'s got something to do with that girl.\\nJoel: Oh, it\\'s got everything to do with that little girl.\\nTommy: Well, go on then.\\nJoel: She\\'s immune.\\nTommy: Immune to what? Oh, c\\'mon.\\nJoel: See, I know...I\\'ve seen her breathe enough spores to take down a dozen\\nTommy: Alright. I\\'ll bite. Why bring her here?\\nJoel: I was supposed to deliver her to the Fireflies... The way I figured it,\\nTommy: I haven\\'t seen a Firefly in years.\\nJoel: But you know where they are. Now I\\'m not asking for much, Tommy. I just\\nTommy: What makes you think I\\'d do this for you?\\nJoel: This isn\\'t for me, Tommy. This is for your damn cause.\\nTommy: My cause is my family now. You ain\\'t talking about some walk in the\\nJoel: Jesus, boy...have Maria get some of your born again friends to do it.\\nTommy: They got families too.\\nJoel: Tommy, I need this.\\nTommy: You want some gear, sure. But I ain\\'t taking that girl off your hands.\\nJoel: This is how you gonna repay me...huh?\\nTommy: Repay you?\\nJoel: For all those goddamn years I took care of us.\\nTommy: Took care?

Ellie?!\\nEllie: I\\'m up here.\\nJoel: Jesus Christ.\\nTommy: I\\'ll keep an eye out. Reckon you guys need to have a chat.\\nEllie: Is this really all they had to worry about? Boys. Movies. Deciding\\nJoel: Get up, we\\'re leaving. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: And if I say no?\\nJoel: Do you even realize what your life means? Huh? Running off like that.\\nEllie: Well, I guess we\\'re both disappointed with each other then.\\nJoel: What do you want from me?\\nEllie: Admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time.\\nJoel: Tommy knows this area better than--\\nEllie: Agh, fuck that.\\nJoel: Well, I\\'m sorry, I trust him better than I trust myself.\\nEllie: Stop with the bullshit. What are you so afraid of? That I\\'m gonna end\\nJoel: How many close calls have we had?\\nEllie: Well, we seem to be doing alright so far.\\nJoel: And now you\\'ll be doing even better with Tommy.\\nEllie: I\\'m not her, you know.\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: Maria told me about Sarah. And I--\\nJoel: Ellie. You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.\\nEllie: I\\'m sorry about your daughter, Joel, but I have lost people too.\\nJoel: You have no idea what loss is.\\nEllie: Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me. Everyone fucking\\nJoel: You\\'re right... You\\'re not my daughter, and I sure as hell ain\\'t your\\nTommy: Get it together. We\\'re not alone.\\nJoel: I got two walking in.\\nTommy: There\\'s more inside already.\\nJoel: Hang back.\\nTommy: Watch yourself.\\nJoel: Alright...house is clear.\\nTommy: Let\\'s get back to the horses.\\nJoel: We\\'re clear.\\nTommy: You want a hand up?\\nEllie: I got it. C\\'mon...\\nTommy: Easy...easy... Whoa... There she is. Kids\\'ll be watching movies tonight.\\nJoel: Where is this lab of theirs?\\nTommy: It\\'s all the way out -- University of Eastern Colorado.\\nJoel: Go Big Horns. Ellie, get off your horse, give it on back to Tommy. I\\'m\\nTommy: What are you doin\\'?\\nJoel: Your wife kinda scares me. I don\\'t want her coming after me.\\nEllie: Sorry for stealing your horse.\\nTommy: Look, come back to town, let\\'s discuss it at least.\\nJoel: Eh, you know me. My mind\\'s all made up.\\nJoel: University Eastern Colorado. How do I find this lab?\\nTommy: It\\'s in the science building, looks like a giant mirror, you can\\'t miss\\nJoel: You take care of that wife of yours.\\nTommy: There\\'s a place for you here, you know.\\nJoel: You good?\\nEllie: I\\'m good.\\nJoel: Adios, little brother. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: So, let me see if I get it straight. If you mess up your fourth down,\\nJoel: Right, it\\'s called turnover.\\nEllie: And if you clear the ten yards then you\\'re back at...first down?\\nJoel: First down, that\\'s right.\\nEllie: Man, it\\'s confusing.\\nJoel: You just gotta play it a couple of times. It\\'ll all make sense.\\nEllie: Okay. None of these buildings look like a mirror to me.\\nJoel: Well, we\\'ll head to central grounds. Should be able to see most of the\\nJoel: Stay, Callus. What kind of name is Callus anyway?\\nEllie: Not my fault you forgot to ask Tommy his name.\\nJoel: Callus.\\nEllie: So, these places...people would live here and just study? Even though\\nJoel: Yeah, study, party, and find themselves. Figure out what they wanted to\\nEllie: What they wanted to do with their lives.\\nJoel: There was a lookout here.\\nEllie: That\\'s a good sign.\\nEllie: That\\'s a giant ram. You guys were like some idol worshippers.\\nJoel: When it came to sports? Hell yeah.\\nEllie: Ooh...it\\'s getting chilly.\\nJoel: It\\'s that time of year.\\nEllie: Hey, over there. Is that it?\\nJoel: Hmm. It does look like a giant mirror.\\nEllie: How many people you think are there? Fireflies, I mean.\\nJoel: Reckon it takes quite a crew to run that operation.\\nEllie: You think there\\'ll be other people my age?\\nJoel: Ahh...I\\'m not sure.\\nJoel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...what is it, boy?\\nEllie: Sounds like runners.\\nJoel: Stay with the horse. I\\'ll go check it out.\\nEllie: Are you sure?\\nJoel: Yes. I don\\'t want him runnin\\' off. I\\'ll be right back.\\nJoel: Huh, looks like someone jerry-rigged this thing. No juice. I\\'ll see if\\nJoel: And that\\'s that.\\nEllie: Hey, I was thinking...I would\\'ve wanted to be an astronaut.\\nJoel: That a fact?\\nEllie: Yeah. Can you imagine being up there all by yourself? Would\\'ve be cool.\\nJoel: Oh...well, when I was a kid I used to want to be a...a singer.\\nEllie: Shut up.\\nJoel: I\\'m serious.\\nEllie: Sing something.\\nJoel: Ah, no.\\nEllie: Come on. I won\\'t laugh.\\nJoel: I don\\'t think so.\\nEllie: Joel. Please.\\nEllie: Aww...are those monkeys?\\nJoel: Yeah, a whole mess of \\'em.\\nEllie: That was kind of awesome.\\nJoel: First time seeing a monkey?\\nEllie: First time seeing a monkey.\\nEllie: Should we have seen someone by now?\\nJoel: Uh...maybe these guys like to keep a low profile.\\nEllie: Yeah. Maybe.\\nEllie: Hey, look. Fireflies. Joel, look!\\nJoel: I see it.\\nEllie: This is good. First sign of Fireflies.\\nJoel: Alright, let\\'s try that gate.\\nEllie: There it is. This won\\'t budge.\\nEllie: Watch yourself.\\nJoel: You too. Oh, damn it. Spores.\\nJoel: Shit...\\nEllie: Joel! Are you OK? What happened in there?\\nJoel: More infected. I\\'m fine!\\nEllie: Here, come open the gate.\\nJoel: Alright. Let\\'s try the gate.\\nEllie: You did it!\\nJoel: Yeah. Come on through. Scootch.\\nEllie: Those clickers -- you think they were Fireflies?\\nJoel: No...no, I don\\'t think so.\\nEllie: Why would they have infected so close to the lab?\\nJoel: Bill used them as a form of defense. Maybe they\\'re doing the same.\\nEllie: Yeah...I could see that.\\nEllie: No guards. No nothing.\\nJoel: Yeah...I\\'d expect to see someone by now. Let\\'s get inside.\\nEllie: Have you ever been to one of these?\\nJoel: What? A university?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: No, not as a student at least.\\nEllie: Why not?\\nJoel: Uhh...I had Sarah when I was pretty young.\\nEllie: Oh...were you married?\\nJoel: For a while.\\nEllie: What happened?\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Too much?\\nJoel: Too much.\\nEllie: Are we ever gonna find living Fireflies?\\nJoel: We better.\\nEllie: Hey, what about over there?\\nJoel: Yeah. That looks like a way in.\\nJoel: It\\'s rusted shut. We\\'ll have to find another way.\\nEllie: Maybe we can get over it.\\nJoel: Whoa. Alright, not what I had in mind, but it\\'ll do.\\nJoel: Alright, we\\'re inside. C\\'mon, kiddo, gimme your hand. There you go.\\nEllie: Thanks. Let\\'s look around.\\nEllie: How will they do it?\\nJoel: Do what?\\nEllie: Get the cure from me? You think it\\'ll hurt?\\nJoel: No, no. They\\'ll probably just draw some blood ?- it don\\'t hurt.\\nEllie: I\\'ve gotten shots before. They vaccinated us at school. It sucked.\\nEllie: Hello? Where are they?\\nEllie: Yoohoo! Fireflies? Cure for mankind over here! Anyone?\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep it down until we figure out what\\'s going on.\\nEllie: Nothing useful.\\nJoel: Ain\\'t nothin\\' here but a bunch of medical mumbo-jumbo.\\nEllie: I don\\'t get it.\\nJoel: Looks like they all just packed up and left in a hurry.\\nEllie: Maybe not all of \\'em.\\nJoel: Stay close.\\nEllie: There are no bodies. That\\'s good, right?\\nJoel: If we find out where they went.\\nJoel: Shit!\\nJoel: Jesus. Well, at least it ain\\'t clickers.\\nEllie: Yeah. No Fireflies either. Well, maybe in all that research they turned\\nJoel: Just keep searching, we\\'ll find something.\\nVoice: If you\\'re looking for the Fireflies, they\\'ve all left.\\nEllie: Yeah, no shit.\\nVoice: I\\'m dead...or I will be soon. Got me some time to reflect.\\nVoice: ...been years that felt like we were!\\nVoice: ...fucking thing was a giant waste of ti--\\nVoice: ...not going to do this anymore...\\nJoel: Come on.\\nVoice: ...looking for the others, they\\'ve all returned to Saint Mary\\'s Hospital\\nEllie: Do you know where that is?\\nJoel: I know the city.\\nEllie: Is it far?\\nJoel: It ain\\'t close. I mean on horseback--\\nEllie: What?\\nEllie: Fireflies?\\nJoel: Get down!\\nEllie: Who the fuck are these guys?\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter. We know where to go, let\\'s get the hell outta here.\\nHunter: Got you, asshole.\\nEllie: Oh shit. Oh man...\\nEllie: What do you want me to do?\\nJoel: Move...\\nEllie: What?\\nJoel: Move!\\nEllie: Oh man...Joel? Oh...\\nJoel: I\\'m gonna need you to pull.\\nEllie: Okay. Alright, you ready? One, two, three.\\nJoel: Pull!\\nJoel: Just get to the damn horse.\\nEllie: Okay. I don\\'t see anyone. Let\\'s go! Joel, how are we doing?\\nJoel: I\\'m fine...I\\'m fine.\\nEllie: Can you handle the window?\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nEllie: Jesus. Come on, move!\\nHunter: I see you!\\nEllie: Shit.\\nHunter: Come on, man.\\nEllie: Alright, just stay here. I\\'m gonna flank this asshole.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nHunter: Those were my friends you killed, asshole. Come on out. You want to\\nHunter: You little bitch.\\nJoel: Shit.\\nEllie: Oh man, we gotta get you out of here.\\nJoel: I\\'m okay.\\nEllie: You\\'re not okay, Joel! Now come on! Move it. There\\'s no one here. Hurry.\\nEllie: You\\'re doing good, just keep at it.\\nJoel: I\\'m coming.\\nEllie: Through these double doors. Oh man. Here, lean on me.\\nJoel: No.\\nEllie: Well can you walk?\\nJoel: Yes.\\nEllie: Then fucking walk. Come on. There\\'s the exit. Just a little bit more,\\nJoel: Behind you!\\nEllie: What?\\nJoel: Ellie!\\nHunter: The kid\\'s got a gun! Watch out! Hey!\\nEllie: Stay the fuck back!\\nEllie: Oh shit, oh shit.\\nHunter 2: You little shit!\\nEllie: Joel. Here, stand up. I swear to god, I get you out of this, you are so\\nJoel: You wish.\\nEllie: Wait here. I\\'ll get the door.\\nJoel: Take your time.\\nEllie: Come on. There you go.\\nHunter: What the fuck? Ah, shit!\\nEllie: Come on.\\nJoel: Just...get the horse.\\nEllie: Alright... Can you get on?\\nJoel: Go.\\nEllie: I think we\\'re safe. Joel. Joel.\\nEllie: Ah, shit. Joel -- here. Get up, get up, get up... You gotta tell me\\nEllie: Oh, this won\\'t last very long.\\nEllie: You\\'ll just startle it.\\nEllie: Where\\'d you go? There he is.\\nEllie: Shit, he heard that.\\nEllie: Oh man. How are you still alive?\\nEllie: What is this place? Everything\\'s cool. This place is not creepy at all.\\nEllie: Who\\'s there? Come out!\\nMan: Hello...we just want to talk.\\nEllie: Any sudden moves and I put one right between your eyes. Ditto for\\nDavid: Um, name\\'s David, this here\\'s my friend James. We\\'re from a larger\\nEllie: So am I -- women and children -- all very hungry too.\\nDavid: Well maybe we could, ah, trade you for some of that meat there. What do\\nEllie: Medicine! Do you have any antibiotics?\\nDavid: We do. Back at the camp. You\\'re welcome to follow us--\\nEllie: I\\'m not following you anywhere. Buddy boy can go get it. He comes back\\nDavid: You put one right between my eyes.\\nEllie: That\\'s right.\\nDavid: Two bottles of penicillin and a syringe. Make it fast. Go on.\\nEllie: I\\'ll take that rifle.\\nDavid: Of course.\\nEllie: Back up.\\nDavid: He\\'s probably gonna be awhile. You, ah, mind if we take some shelter\\nEllie: Bring him with us.\\nDavid: There. You know you really shouldn\\'t be out here all on your own.\\nEllie: I don\\'t like company.\\nDavid: I see. What\\'s your name?\\nEllie: Why?\\nDavid: Look, I understand it\\'s not easy to trust a couple of strangers.\\nEllie: We\\'ll see.\\nEllie: You had another gun?\\nDavid: Sorry.\\nDavid: Okay, I\\'d really like my rifle back now.\\nEllie: No, you have your pistol.\\nDavid: I hope you know how to use that thing.\\nEllie: I\\'ve had some practice.\\nDavid: No matter what, we have to keep them out. Let\\'s hope they don\\'t find\\nEllie: Okay.\\nDavid: Make every shot count now.\\nEllie: I\\'ve done this before.\\nDavid: You weren\\'t kidding. You\\'re a better shot with that thing than I am.\\nEllie: Agh, c\\'mon, c\\'mon.\\nEllie: Oh shit.\\nDavid: Nothin\\' over here. Oh lord, there\\'s a whole lot of \\'em comin\\' at us.\\nDavid: Screw it. We\\'re gettin\\' outta this room!\\nDavid: Alright, kid. This way.\\nEllie: Fucking infected.\\nDavid: C\\'mon. I\\'ll block their path. Cover the stairs!\\nDavid: Follow me. Through here.\\nEllie: Okay. Do you know where you\\'re going?\\nDavid: I\\'ve never set foot in this place.\\nEllie: Oh. Great.\\nDavid: It\\'s clear. This way.\\nEllie: Right behind you.\\nDavid: How you holdin\\' up?\\nEllie: You don\\'t need to worry about me.\\nDavid: Alright.

How on earth did they use this building?\\nEllie: So what do we do?\\nDavid: We hold our ground.\\nEllie: Is there any other choice?\\nDavid: We die. Get ready.\\nEllie: You hear that? They\\'re on the roof!\\nDavid: I know!\\nDavid: We\\'re doin\\' fine, kid.\\nEllie: It doesn\\'t feel like it.\\nDavid: Just stay focused. We\\'ll make it.

What\\'d I tell ya? Alright. Let\\'s head on back, check on\\nDavid: You handled yourself pretty nice back there. Ha, whew, I say we make a\\nEllie: Psshh. We got lucky.\\nDavid: Lucky? No, no...no such thing as luck. No, you see I believe that\\nEllie: Sure.\\nDavid: I do. And I can prove it to you. Now, this winter has been especially\\nDavid: Now don\\'t get upset. It\\'s not your fault. You\\'re just a kid. James,\\nJames: No way, David. I\\'m not gonna let her go.\\nDavid: Lower the gun. Now give her the medicine.\\nJames: The others won\\'t be happy about this.\\nDavid: Yeah, well, that\\'s not your concern.\\nEllie: Move the fuck out of the way.\\nDavid: You won\\'t survive long out there. I can protect you.\\nEllie: No thanks.\\nEllie: Let\\'s get outta here. Come on.\\nEllie: Come on. Okay...\\nEllie: Joel? Oh... I only managed to get a little bit of food. But...I did get\\nEllie: Sorry. All done. That\\'s it. You\\'re gonna make it.\\nEllie: Oh, fuck. They tracked me. I\\'m gonna draw them away from here. I\\'ll come\\nEllie: Easy... Go...

Okay...\\nHunter: She fell down the hill somewhere. I don\\'t see her though.\\nHunter 2: She\\'s running for the cabins!\\nHunter: Are we really killing her? David said he wants her alive.\\nHunter 2: He doesn\\'t get to make that call. James to me it\\'s the girl from\\nHunter: Oh shit. I didn\\'t know that was her. Screw David, then. I ain\\'t taking\\nHunter 2: I just want to finish up and go home. I\\'m freezing my ass off.\\nEllie: Nature track... Okay, that should get me out of here. You got this,\\nEllie: Here we go. I got this. Agh...\\nEllie: That\\'s the way back. Hang in there, Joel.\\nHunter: Cover the grounds! Make sure she\\'s not hiding somewhere over here!\\nEllie: How do I get outta here?\\nEllie: I don\\'t wanna get trapped in here. Agh, where\\'s the way out?\\nHunter: She\\'s on this side of the lodge!\\nDavid: Relax... Keeping you alive here. There you go. There you go.\\nEllie: Oh...\\nDavid: How are you feeling?\\nEllie: Super.\\nDavid: Here. You should eat. I know you\\'re hungry -- been out for quite some\\nEllie: What is it?\\nDavid: It\\'s deer.\\nEllie: With some human helping on the side?\\nDavid: No. No, I promise. It\\'s...just the deer meat.\\nEllie: You\\'re a fucking animal.\\nDavid: Oh...you\\'re awfully quick to judgment. Considering you and your friend\\nEllie: They didn\\'t give us a choice.\\nDavid: And you think we have a choice? Is that it? You kill to survive...and\\nEllie: So now what? You gonna chop me up into tiny pieces?\\nDavid: I\\'d rather not. Please tell me your name.\\nEllie: You\\'re so full of shit.\\nDavid: On the contrary, I\\'ve been, ah, been quite honest with you. Now I think\\nEllie: Convince them of what?\\nDavid: That you can come around. You have heart. You\\'re loyal. And you\\'re\\nEllie: Oh...\\nEllie: Oh, fuck...\\nDavid: You stupid little girl. You are making it very difficult to keep you\\nEllie: Ellie.\\nDavid: What?\\nEllie: Tell them that...Ellie is the little girl that broke your fucking\\nDavid: How did you put it? Hmm? Tiny pieces? See you in the morning, Ellie.\\nJoel: Ellie? Ellie?! Where the hell are you?\\nJoel: Ellie! Where\\'d she run off to?\\nHunter: Oh shit! He\\'s over there!\\nJoel: Shit.\\nHunter 2: Move it!

You can verify it. Go ask him. Go on. He\\'ll tell ya.\\nHunter 2: Fuck you, man. He told you what you wanted. I ain\\'t telling you shit.\\nJoel: That\\'s alright. I believe him.\\nHunter 2: No, wait!\\nJames: Wake-y, wake-y. Come on.\\nEllie: Let go!\\nJames: Get--\\nEllie: Stop!\\nDavid: I warned you.\\nEllie: I\\'m infected! I\\'m infected!\\nDavid: Really?\\nEllie: ...and so are you. Right there. Roll up my sleeve. Look at it!\\nDavid: I\\'ll play along.\\nEllie: What\\'d you say? Everything happens for a reason, right?\\nJames: What the hell is that?\\nDavid: She would\\'ve turned by now. It can\\'t be real.\\nJames: Looks pretty fucking real to me!\\nEllie: Okay. Shit. Oh man. What the fuck is wrong with these people?\\nDavid: Where you going, Ellie? This is my town!\\nEllie: I need a gun. Okay, I can do this.\\nHunter: We heard gunshots!\\nDavid: Infected!\\nHunter: What?\\nDavid: The girl. She\\'s infected and she got out.\\nFemale Hunter: This is bad, David.\\nDavid: Alright, I need you to round up everyone who isn\\'t armed and get \\'em\\nFemale Hunter: Oh my god. I\\'ll take the kids to the shelter.\\nEllie: Oh fuck.\\nHunter: Tired of this shit. He\\'s crossed the line this time.\\nHunter 2: I\\'ve been saying this for months.\\nHunter: We\\'ve indulged him enough. This girl killed our men and now she\\'s\\nHunter 2: Let\\'s clean this mess up...then we can have a town meeting. Put his\\nEllie: They\\'re everywhere.\\nHunter: What if she bites someone?\\nHunter 2: Relax. She\\'s not biting anybody.\\nHunter: I\\'m saying we could have a real situation here.\\nHunter 3: We already have a situation and we\\'re gonna take care of it. Now\\nDavid: You\\'re easy to track.\\nDavid: How did you do it?\\nDavid: That\\'s alright. There\\'s nowhere to go! You want out? You\\'re gonna have\\nEllie: Ah, you fuck.\\nDavid: You know, I...I wish you hadn\\'t killed James. He\\'s a good kid -- just\\nEllie: Creepy piece of shit.\\nDavid: No? Nothin\\'? Sure about that? Alright then.\\nDavid: That was good, kid. It\\'s gonna be alright.\\nDavid: You know, you keep surprising me. It\\'s a shame you wouldn\\'t come around.\\nEllie: Yeah, go fuck yourself.\\nDavid: Okay then. Don\\'t say I didn\\'t give you a chance. You know, I love how\\nEllie: Ah, you crazy fuck.\\nDavid: It didn\\'t have to be this way, you know. You brought this on yourself.\\nDavid: Run, little rabbit, run.\\nHunter: This is pointless. I can\\'t see a thing.\\nHunter 2: Just keep searching. If she comes through here, we gotta catch her.\\nHunter: We should be guarding the shelter. We got an infected running around\\nHunter 2: Look. This kid is deadly and we don\\'t know where she\\'s gonna turn\\nJoel: What is this? Why is Ellie\\'s stuff here?\\nJoel: Oh, Christ. I gotta find her. I gotta find her.\\nJoel: Holy shit. Ellie...\\nDavid: I knew you had heart. Y\\'know, it\\'s okay to give up. Ain\\'t no shame in\\nDavid: You can try beggin\\'.\\nEllie: Fuck you.\\nDavid: You think you know me? Huh? Well, let me tell you somethin\\'. You have\\nJoel: Ellie! Stop. Stop.\\nEllie: No! Don\\'t fucking touch me!\\nJoel: Shhh. Shhh.\\nEllie: No--\\nJoel: It\\'s okay. It\\'s me, it\\'s me. Look, look.

Hospital. This is where we get off. Let\\'s go, kiddo. Heh. Feel\\nEllie: Huh? Oh, yeah, sure, that sounds great.\\nEllie: I dreamt about flying the other night.\\nJoel: Oh yeah?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: Go on, tell me about it.\\nEllie: So, I\\'m on this big plane full of people. And everyone is screaming and\\nJoel: Hmpf. Well, you know, dreams are weird.\\nJoel: Look at that. Another city, another abandoned quarantine zone. There\\'s\\nJoel: Maybe we cut through here, huh? Everything all right?\\nEllie: Yeah, I\\'m fine.\\nJoel: You just kinda seem extra quiet today.\\nEllie: Oh, sorry.\\nJoel: No, it\\'s not...it\\'s fine.\\nJoel: Well, we could use that ladder. Here we go.\\nJoel: Ellie. Ellie.\\nEllie: What?\\nJoel: The ladder, c\\'mon.\\nEllie: Right... Okay... Oh my god. Whoa.\\nJoel: What is it? Ellie? Ellie!\\nEllie: Oh...you gotta see this.\\nJoel: What is it? I don\\'t see anything. What the hell is--?\\nEllie: Are you kidding me? C\\'mon, hurry up.\\nJoel: What in the Sam Hill?\\nEllie: Whoa.

So fucking cool. Aw, where\\'s it off to? Here, c\\'mon... Let\\'s\\nJoel: Slow down, kiddo.\\nEllie: Hurry up. C\\'mon, c\\'mon, c\\'mon!\\nEllie: Oh man...wow. Look at those things.\\nJoel: So...this everything you were hoping for?\\nEllie: It\\'s got its ups and downs, but...you can\\'t deny the view though.\\nJoel: We don\\'t have to do this. You know that, right?\\nEllie: What\\'s the other option?\\nJoel: Go back to Tommy\\'s. Just...be done with this whole damn thing.\\nEllie: After all we\\'ve been though. Everything that I\\'ve done. It can\\'t be\\nJoel: Well, I ain\\'t leavin\\' without ya, so let\\'s go wrap this up.\\nJoel: Well, this place takes me back.\\nEllie: How so?\\nJoel: It was right after everything went down. I ended up in a triage just like\\nEllie: Is that after you lost Sarah?\\nJoel: Yes, it was...\\nEllie: I...can\\'t imagine losing someone you love like that. Losing everything\\nJoel: That\\'s okay, Ellie.\\nEllie: Hey, Joel. I got somethin\\' for you. Here. Maria showed me this to me\\nJoel: Well, no matter how hard you try, I guess you can\\'t escape your past. \\nEllie: This time it\\'s gonna be different. I just know it.\\nJoel: What do you mean?\\nEllie: They\\'re gonna be there -- the Fireflies, I mean. I\\'m sure of it.\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nEllie: Holy shit!\\nJoel: Stay quiet.\\nEllie: Oh my god. There\\'s so many of them.\\nJoel: I know.

      "Man: Yeah -- see you around.\n",
      "Tess: Marlene lookin' for Robert? What do you make of that?\n",

      "Man: Y'all take it easy out there.\n",
      "Tess: Agh, this place reeks. They need to watch what they throw away down here.\n",
      "Tess: Let there be light. Let's grab our gear. Our backpacks are still here\n",

      "Joel: For his sake...he better.\n",
      "Tess: Look, once we get our merchandise back, it should be easy to unload.\n",
      "Joel: Speaking of merchandise, when's the next shipment due?\n",

      "Tess: Move up, move up.\n",
      "Sentry 3: I meant to tell you, I was down on Jordan Street, and all these\n",
      "Sentry 4: Let me guess, Fireflies?\n",
      "Sentry 3: Yup, they lined 'em up against the wall and bang, bang, bang, they\n",
      "Sentry 4: Holy shit.\n",
      "Sentry 3: Yeah, I hear it's like that all over the city. They're cracking down\n",
      "Sentry 4: I got a cousin with 'em.\n",
      "Sentry 3: Seriously?\n",

      "Sentry 2: Even if he is, then what? I'm telling you, this zone is done for. We\n",
      "Sentry: You're insane. Going outside the wall is suicide.\n",
      "Sentry 2: Plenty of other smugglers do it. What do you think's gonna happen\n",
      "Sentry: I'd still take my chances in here.\n",
      "Tess: That office. Robert must've run in there. Let's not wait around.\n",
      "Robert: Oh shit! Get back! Get the fuck back!\n",

      "Tess: Quit your squirmin'. You were saying?\n",
      "Robert: I sold 'em.\n",
      "Tess: Excuse me?\n",
      "Robert: I didn't have much of a choice. I owed someone.\n",
      "Tess: You owed us. I say you bet on the wrong horse.\n",
      "Robert: I just need more time. Just gimme a week.\n",
      "Tess: You know, I might've done that if you hadn't tried to fucking kill me.\n",
      "Robert: C'mon, it wasn't like--\n",

      "Tess: What?\n",
      "Robert: Look, they're basically all dead. We can just-- Just go in there,\n",
      "Tess: That is a stupid idea.\n",
      "Joel: Well, now what?\n",
      "Tess: We go get our merchandise back.\n",
      "Joel: How?\n",
      "Tess: I don't know. We explain it to them. Look, let's go find a Firefly.\n",

      "Marlene: Where's Robert?\n",
      "Marlene: I needed him alive.\n",
      "Tess: The guns he gave you, they weren't his to sell. I want them back.\n",
      "Marlene: Doesn't work like that, Tess.\n",
      "Tess: The hell it doesn't.\n",
      "Marlene: I paid for those guns. You want 'em back? You're gonna have to earn\n",
      "Tess: How many cards are we talking about?\n",
      "Marlene: I don't give a damn about ration cards. I need something smuggled out\n",

      "Marlene: Ellie, we won't get another shot at this.\n",
      "Joel: Hey -- we're smuggling her?\n",
      "Marlene: There's a crew of Fireflies that'll meet you at the Capitol Building.\n",
      "Tess: That's not exactly close.\n",
      "Marlene: You're capable. You hand her off, come back, the weapon are yours.\n",
      "Tess: Speaking of which, where are they?\n",
      "Marlene: Back in our camp.\n",
      "Tess: We're not smuggling shit until I see them.\n",
      "Marlene: You'll follow me. You can verify the weapons, I can get patched up.\n",
      "Joel: Whoa, whoa. I don't think that's the best idea.\n",
      "Ellie: Bullshit! I'm not going with him.\n",

      "Joel: Yep.\n",
      "Ellie: Like illegal things?\n",
      "Joel: Sometimes.\n",
      "Ellie: You ever smuggle a kid before?\n",
      "Joel: No. That's a first. So what's the deal with you and Marlene, anyways?\n",
      "Ellie: I don't know. She's my friend, I guess.\n",

      "Joel: Shit, they're going to be out in numbers.\n",
      "Tess: I know.\n",
      "Tess: Alright, Ellie. When I give you the signal, we run. Now. Run. Stay away\n",
      "Ellie: Sure, yeah.\n",
      "Joel: Goddammit! They're everywhere.\n",
      "Tess: Soldiers. Right there.\n",
      "Joel: I see 'em, I see 'em.\n",
      "Soldier: They must've gotten through. Check the trenches!\n",
      "Joel: Just stay back.\n",
      "Soldier 2: I don't see anything down there. Are you sure they came this way?\n",
      "Soldier: Unless we're told otherwise, we just keep scanning.\n",

      "Tess: Come on, kid. Follow Joel.\n",
      "Ellie: Man, too close.\n",
      "Joel: You see anything?\n",
      "Tess: Clear back here. How's it look up ahead?\n",
      "Joel: So far, so good.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay...\n",
      "Joel: Shh, shh, shh. I hear 'em up ahead.\n",
      "Guard: Ops said they took out a couple of our boys.\n",
      "Guard 2: It's gotta be those fucking Fireflies retaliating.\n",
      "Guard: We'll be done with them soon enough.\n",
      "Tess: Go, go.\n",
      "Guard: Fuck it. Let the clickers get 'em.\n",

      "Joel: Come on.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, they're gone.\n",
      "Tess: Look, what was the plan? Let's say that we deliver you to the Fireflies,\n",
      "Ellie: Marlene... She said that they have their own little quarantine zone.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, we've heard that before, huh, Tess?\n",
      "Ellie: And that...whatever happened to me is the key to finding a vaccine.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, Jesus.\n",
      "Ellie: It's what she said.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, I'm sure she did.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, fuck you, man. I didn't ask for this.\n",
      "Joel: Me neither. Tess, what the hell are we doing here?\n",
      "Tess: What if it's true?\n",
      "Joel: I can't believe--\n",
      "Tess: What if, Joel? I mean we've come this far, let's just finish it.\n",
      "Joel: Do I need to remind you what is out there?\n",
      "Tess: I get it. This way. If we cut through downtown, we can hit the capitol\n",
      "Joel: We hope.\n",
      "Ellie: Holy moley. I guess this is what these buildings look like up close.\n",
      "Tess: They bombed the hell out of the surrounding areas to the quarantine\n",
      "Ellie: Ahhh, what the hell was that?\n",
      "Joel: Tess, do you hear that?\n",
      "Tess: Yeah. Sounded pretty far away though.\n",
      "Joel: Shit.\n",
      "Ellie: Are we safe?\n",
      "Tess: For now. Come on.\n",
      "Ellie: Damn. That's quite a drop.\n",
      "Joel: Well, there's the capitol building.\n",
      "Tess: Yeah, we need to get around this mess.\n",
      "Ellie: This is the downtown area?\n",
      "Tess: It was. Now it's a giant wasteland.\n",
      "Joel: Over here.\n",
      "Joel: You find anything over there?\n",
      "Tess: No.\n",
      "Joel: Keep looking.\n",

      "Tess: Comin'.\n",
      "Tess: He's been ripped apart.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah...\n",
      "Tess: Body's pretty fresh.\n",
      "Ellie: Is that bad?\n",
      "Tess: Yeah, might be... Let's not stick around.\n",
      "Tess: Another one. Shit.\n",
      "Joel: Looks like these guys died waiting for backup.\n",
      "Joel: Goddammit. Clicker.\n",
      "Ellie: Geez. What's wrong with its face?\n",
      "Tess: That's what years of infection'll do to you.\n",
      "Ellie: So what, are they...blind?\n",
      "Tess: Sort of. They see using sound.\n",
      "Ellie: Like bats.\n",
      "Tess: Like bats. If you hear one clicking, you gotta hide. That's how they\n",
      "Ellie: Shit.\n",
      "Joel: Whole building feels like it's about to fall apart.\n",
      "Ellie: Totally cool. Everything is totally cool.\n",

      "Ellie: Joel!\n",
      "Joel: Thanks...\n",
      "Ellie: You alright?\n",
      "Joel: It's nothin'.\n",
      "Tess: Let's search for supplies.\n",
      "Ellie: Shit! Oh, that was so intense.\n",
      "Tess: You said it. Here, patch yourself up.\n",
      "Joel: C'mon. Let's get the hell outta here.\n",
      "Tess: Up there, look.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeesh...\n",
      "Joel: Just see if there's a way through.\n",
      "Tess: Okay... It's clear. C'mon, Ellie.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, kid, you're up.\n",
      "Tess: Come on. You got it. There you go. C'mon, big guy. Gimme your hand.\n",
      "Ellie: Clickers?\n",
      "Tess: Oh, shit. Go, go, go.\n",
      "Tess: That's our way out, over the scaffolding.\n",
      "Tess: I think that's it. Ellie, you okay?\n",
      "Ellie: Other than shitting my pants...I'm fine.\n",
      "Tess: Let's go.\n",
      "Joel: Gimme a second.\n",
      "Joel: Here you go, ladies.\n",
      "Tess: All right, come on.\n",
      "Ellie: The stairwell's blocked. Should we go back up?\n",
      "Tess: Ahh, this is crazy. Just don't look down.\n",
      "Ellie: Wha--? Are you serious?\n",
      "Tess: C'mon, Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah... Don't look down. Don't look down.\n",
      "Tess: You're okay. We got a way through.\n",
      "Joel: Oh boy...\n",
      "Tess: Runners.\n",
      "Joel: I'll go check it out. Stay with the girl.\n",
      "Joel: Alright. Come on down.\n",
      "Tess: I'm impressed, Joel.\n",
      "Joel: Pssh. Let's just get outta here.\n",
      "Joel: Alright. Tess, go.\n",
      "Tess: Alright, hold on. Here -- this'll work. Alright, gimme a hand, Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay... Alright, that should do it.\n",
      "Tess: There, see? We're doin' alright.\n",
      "Joel: Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa.\n",
      "Tess: Down we go.\n",
      "Joel: Let's get to it. We can get through here. Watch your back.\n",
      "Tess: You know, I was thinkin'...after we get back, we can take it easy for a\n",
      "Joel: You want to take it easy?\n",
      "Tess: Hey, you're the one who's always going on about layin' low.\n",
      "Joel: And you always brushed me off.\n",
      "Tess: Well, I won't this time.\n",
      "Joel: I'll believe it when I see it. Through here.\n",
      "Tess: Joel, over here.\n",
      "Tess: Look at his sleeve. Firefly.\n",
      "Joel: These guys aren't doin' too well in or out of the city. Let's hope\n",
      "Joel: They're from the quarantine zone.\n",
      "Tess: See...they're not our guys.\n",
      "Joel: Over there, see it?\n",
      "Tess: Shit. God, we're almost out. Okay, Joel, you take point. I'll watch the\n",
      "Ellie: Sure.\n",
      "Joel: This way. We're almost out. C'mon.\n",
      "Tess: Yeah, go over there. Quick, before it comes back.\n",
      "Joel: Alright. C'mon.\n",
      "Joel: Get up here.\n",
      "Ellie: Holy shit. We actually made it.\n",
      "Joel: Everyone okay?\n",
      "Tess: Yes. Let's move.\n",
      "Ellie: You guys are pretty good at this stuff.\n",
      "Joel: It's called luck, and it is gonna run out. Which way we goin', Tess?\n",
      "Tess: Uh...capitol building's in this direction. How do we get up over this\n",
      "Joel: Climb on up. Maybe we can cut through here.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, that worked out great last time. Sorry -- I'm just sayin'.\n",
      "Tess: Shhh-shh.\n",
      "Joel: What? I don't hear anything.\n",
      "Tess: Okay, double time.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, shit....\n",
      "Ellie: Oh -- they're coming.\n",
      "Joel: I know.\n",
      "Tess: Okay, that's good, that's good. Go.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay, Joel.\n",
      "Joel: Drop it!\n",
      "Ellie: Oh...you got something on your shoe.\n",
      "Ellie: Gross.\n",
      "Joel: Okay. How do we get out of this place?\n",
      "Tess: Let's find out. So Marlene thinks your immune?\n",
      "Ellie: Well, that's what she believes.\n",
      "Tess: Well, how were you bitten? I mean you must've been somewhere you\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, I'd sneak out. I was in this military boarding school.\n",
      "Tess: You'd sneak out?\n",
      "Ellie: You know, explore the city. I was in the mall when I ran into infected.\n",
      "Tess: That place is completely off-limits. How the hell did you get in there?\n",
      "Ellie: I...had my ways. Anyways, one of those -- what you guys call runners\n",
      "Tess: I see. Were you with Marlene when you were bitten?\n",
      "Ellie: No. I went to her for help afterwards.\n",
      "Tess: Knowing her, I'm surprised she didn't shoot you.\n",
      "Ellie: She almost did. Hope she's alright.\n",
      "Tess: I told you. She's gonna be fine.\n",
      "Ellie: Ow. Shit. Sorry, sorry. That was me.\n",
      "Joel: Tess.\n",
      "Ellie: Sorry!\n",
      "Tess: C'mon. Stay close to me.\n",
      "Ellie: What is this place?\n",
      "Tess: It's an old museum. Some of these things are hundreds of years old.\n",
      "Ellie: Really? Wow.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, watch your head. Hurry. Go, go, go. Shit...sonofa...\n",
      "Tess: Joel. Joel!\n",
      "Joel: I'm alive. I'll make my way around to you.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh... Look they're here!\n",
      "Joel: Tess?\n",
      "Tess: Run. Run!\n",
      "Joel: Shit.\n",
      "Joel: Tess.\n",
      "Tess: Ellie, stay back!\n",
      "Joel: Tess!\n",
      "Tess: I'm fine.\n",
      "Ellie: Guys, get in here!\n",
      "Tess: The girl!\n",
      "Joel: Shit.\n",
      "Joel: That was too damn close.\n",
      "Tess: Oh shit.\n",
      "Joel: Tess, how're you holdin' up?\n",
      "Tess: Just a bit winded. This way. This'll get us to the roof.\n",
      "Joel: How 'bout you, kid? You okay?\n",
      "Ellie: Define okay.\n",
      "Joel: Are you still breathing?\n",
      "Ellie: Do small, panicked breaths count?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, they count.\n",
      "Ellie: Alright. Then I'm okay.\n",
      "Tess: We gotta find a way across. There she is. That's our building.\n",
      "Joel: Alright. Now watch your step as you goin' up 'cause it's gonna be a\n",
      "Ellie: Pssh.\n",
      "Joel: Well, is that everything you hoped for?\n",
      "Ellie: Jury's still out. But, man...you can't deny that view.\n",
      "Tess: C'mon. This way. Hey! Pick it up. Look, we're almost done. Stay focused.\n",
      "Joel: Yes, ma'am.\n",
      "Tess: It's right around this corner. C'mon.\n",
      "Joel: Let's keep moving, kid.\n",
      "Joel: There we go. Home stretch, Tess.\n",
      "Ellie: Um...just so it's out there. I can't swim.\n",
      "Tess: Look, it looks like it's shallow on the right side. Follow me.\n",
      "Ellie: I'm glad Marlene hired you guys.\n",
      "Tess: What do you mean?\n",
      "Ellie: I know you guys are getting paid for this -- but I'm trying to say\n",
      "Tess: Yeah, sure thing.\n",
      "Tess: No. No, no.\n",
      "Ellie: What happens now?\n",
      "Joel: What are you doing, Tess?\n",
      "Tess: Oh, god. Maybe they, ah, maybe they had a map or something to tell us\n",
      "Joel: How far are we gonna take this?\n",
      "Tess: As far as it needs to go. Where was this lab of theirs?\n",
      "Ellie: She never said. She only mentioned it was someplace out west.\n",
      "Joel: What are we doing here? This is not us.\n",
      "Tess: What do you know about us? About me?\n",
      "Joel: I know that you are smarter than this.\n",
      "Tess: Really? Guess what, we're shitty people, Joel. It's been that way for a\n",
      "Joel: No, we are survivors!\n",
      "Tess: This is our chance--\n",
      "Joel: It is over, Tess! Now we tried. Let's just go home.\n",
      "Tess: I'm not...I'm not going anywhere. This is my last stop.\n",
      "Joel: What?\n",
      "Tess: Our luck had to run out sooner or later.\n",
      "Joel: What are you going on about--\n",
      "Tess: No don't-- Don't touch me.\n",
      "Ellie: Holy shit. She's infected.\n",
      "Tess: Joel...\n",
      "Joel: Let me see it.\n",
      "Tess: I didn't mean for this--\n",
      "Joel: Show it to me.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, Christ.\n",
      "Tess: Oops, right? Give me your arm.\n",
      "Tess: This was three weeks. I was bitten an hour ago and it's already worse.\n",
      "Joel: No, no, no, that was your crusade. I am not doin' that.\n",
      "Tess: Yes you are. Look, there's enough here that you have to feel some sort\n",
      "Ellie: Shit.\n",

      "Guard: Watch the exit!\n",
      "Tess: They're here.\n",
      "Joel: Dammit.\n",
      "Tess: I can buy you some time, but you have to run.\n",
      "Ellie: What? You want us to just leave you here?\n",
      "Tess: Yes.\n",
      "Joel: There is no way that--\n",
      "Tess: I will not turn into one of those things. Come on. Make this easy for me.\n",
      "Joel: I can fight--\n",
      "Tess: No, just go! Just fucking go.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: I'm sorry, I didn't -- I didn't mean for this.\n",
      "Joel: Get a move on.\n",
      "Guard: We know you're in there! Drop your weapons and come out with your hands\n",
      "Ellie: What the fuck! I can't believe we did that.\n",
      "Joel: Stop.\n",
      "Ellie: We just left her to die.\n",
      "Joel: Stop. You stay close to me. We need to move.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh man...\n",
      "Joel: Just keep pushing forward.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh my god. Tess...\n",
      "Guard: Target neutralized. She took out two of my men. Copy that. You, take\n",
      "Guard 2: Yes, sir.\n",
      "Ellie: They're gonna be here soon.\n",
      "Joel: We're through.\n",
      "Ellie: What do we do? Joel?\n",
      "Joel: I got this.\n",
      "Ellie: What're we doing? Joel, how're we gonna get outta here?\n",
      "Joel: Alright. We're gonna have to go through that hall.\n",
      "Guard: They had to come through here. Comb the area.\n",
      "Joel: Stay down. I don't know how many more there are.\n",
      "Guard: They still haven't found the last two.\n",
      "Guard 2: I heard one of 'em was a kid.\n",
      "Guard: Does it matter? They took out a bunch of our guys.\n",
      "Guard 2: Jesus. Well hey, after today this whole Firefly bullshit will be\n",

      "Joel: Goddammit.\n",
      "Ellie: Get down.\n",
      "Guard: No target. I repeat, no target.\n",
      "Ellie: There's a soldier over there.\n",
      "Radio: Understood. Hold your position and wait for reinforcements.\n",
      "Guard: Copy that. Holding position.\n",
      "Joel: How the hell are you breathin' in this stuff?\n",
      "Ellie: I wasn't lying to you.\n",
      "Guard 2: Did you spot 'em?\n",
      "Guard: No, place is empty.\n",

      "Joel: Well, shit.\n",
      "Ellie: Should we climb it?\n",
      "Joel: No, wire on top of it. We gotta find a way to go around.\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa, look. Fireflies. I mean, real fireflies.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, I see that.\n",
      "Ellie: Sorry, I...I lost myself for a sec.\n",
      "Joel: Here we go.\n",
      "Joel: That you, Bill?\n",
      "Ellie: Where do you usually meet him?\n",
      "Joel: Huh? Different places.\n",
      "Ellie: You've never been here, have you?\n",
      "Joel: I know this is where he lives, but...no, I ain't never been here\n",
      "Ellie: And that smoke, you think that's him?\n",
      "Joel: Sure as hell better be.\n",
      "Ellie: Well, let's go check it out then.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, come on. Down here. Watch your step; it's a good drop.\n",
      "Joel: Are you alright?\n",
      "Ellie: I'm trying to learn how to whistle.\n",
      "Joel: You don't know how to whistle?\n",
      "Ellie: Well does it sound like I know how to whistle?\n",
      "Joel: Oh, shit. It's jammed from the other side.\n",
      "Ellie: Here, boost me up.\n",
      "Joel: No, that's not such a good idea.\n",
      "Ellie: Well, I can't boost you up. How else are we gonna open it?\n",
      "Joel: Alright. Gimme your foot. Now just open it. Nothing else.\n",
      "Ellie: Sure thing.\n",
      "Joel: Careful.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay. Ah, let's see. Okay. Ta-da.\n",
      "Joel: Good job.\n",
      "Ellie: Thank you. So, let's say we get a car from this buddy of yours. Then\n",
      "Joel: Well, then we go find Tommy.\n",
      "Ellie: Marlene said he's your brother.\n",
      "Joel: And more importantly he was a Firefly. He'd know where to take you.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, okay.\n",
      "Joel: He lives far from here which is why we need the car.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, look. Gnomes.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah. Those are gnomes.\n",
      "Ellie: Man, I had an art book filled with these. I always thought they were\n",
      "Joel: Alright, then.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh...look at that.\n",
      "Joel: What, you play this before?\n",
      "Ellie: Nah. But I had a friend that knew everything about this game.\n",
      "Joel: Well, I was never a big fan of these things.\n",
      "Ellie: I wish I could play it.\n",
      "Ellie: \"Mandatory evacuation.\" Evacuate to where?\n",
      "Joel: Where you think? Quarantine zone. See, some places got a head's up\n",
      "Ellie: Man, must be hard. Just...leaving all your stuff behind like that.\n",
      "Joel: That ain't the hard part.\n",
      "Joel: Hmm. Yeah, that's Bill's handiwork.\n",
      "Ellie: Anybody else live in this town?\n",
      "Joel: Far as I know, it's just him.\n",
      "Ellie: Fireflies were everywhere, huh?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, they were. Hoping to restore the country to what it was.\n",
      "Ellie: Well...with a vaccine, maybe they will.\n",
      "Joel: Maybe.\n",
      "Joel: Jesus!\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa, Nelly. Wha--? What the hell was that?\n",
      "Joel: That...would be one of Bill's traps.\n",
      "Ellie: Your friend a bit paranoid, maybe?\n",
      "Joel: Now that's putting it lightly.\n",
      "Ellie: What's the deal with this guy?\n",
      "Joel: Well, he helped us smuggle stuff into the city. He's... He knows how to\n",
      "Ellie: Well let's hope we don't blow up trying to find him.\n",
      "Joel: Just watch your step. You'll be fine.\n",
      "Ellie: Geez. Bill good with a bow?\n",
      "Joel: I reckon he is.\n",
      "Joel: Hey... Look at that.\n",
      "Ellie: Let me use that. I'm a pretty good shot with that thing.\n",
      "Joel: How 'bout we just leave this kind of stuff to me.\n",
      "Ellie: Well, we could both be armed. Cover each other.\n",
      "Joel: I don't think so.\n",
      "Joel: Here, we can actually use this. It's all clear, come on up.\n",
      "Ellie: Alright.\n",
      "Joel: Let's give this baby a whirl.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh fuck.\n",
      "Joel: Now, listen. Bill ain't exactly the most stable of individuals. So when\n",
      "Ellie: I understand.\n",
      "Joel: We gotta be clear on this. He... He don't take too kindly to strangers.\n",
      "Ellie: Alright.\n",
      "Joel: Bill's a good guy, he just definitely needs some time warming up to you,\n",
      "Joel: See that wire? Stay underneath it okay? Just keep your head low and\n",
      "Ellie: Alright.\n",
      "Ellie: You hear that?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, shit, you're gonna go in there?\n",
      "Joel: I wanna see what we can find.\n",
      "Ellie: You're gonna find my body when I die from a heart attack.\n",
      "Joel: Don't worry. I got this.\n",
      "Ellie: Geez. That thing scared the shit outta me.\n",
      "Joel: Well, while we're here, let's search the place.\n",
      "Joel: C'mon, let's get the hell outta here.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Joel: Shit. Look at this. Alright, stand back.\n",
      "Ellie: Alright.\n",
      "Joel: That's one way to do it.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, shit. Those things are kinda awesome.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, see that? Get back.\n",
      "Joel: Come on. Just stay close. Ellie, come on, just...\n",
      "Joel: Oh, shit!\n",
      "Ellie: Joel!\n",
      "Joel: God...\n",
      "Ellie: Here...I got you.\n",
      "Joel: Goddammit, Bill...\n",
      "Ellie: What just happened?\n",
      "Joel: It's another one of Bill's stupid traps! There, that fridge. It looks\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Joel: Cut that rope and it'll bring me down!\n",
      "Ellie: On it!\n",
      "Ellie: Joel?\n",
      "Joel: Shit, here they come!\n",
      "Ellie: Joel!\n",
      "Joel: Just tend to the rope! Ellie, how's it looking?\n",
      "Ellie: I'm going as fast as I can!\n",
      "Joel: Ellie!\n",
      "Ellie: Agh, I just need a bit more time!\n",
      "Joel: Oh, fuck! Anytime, Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: Hold on.\n",
      "Joel: You alright?\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah!\n",
      "Joel: C'mon. You can do it.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay... Here, catch.\n",
      "Joel: Thanks.\n",
      "Joel: Hurry, you're gettin' close.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Joel: Dammit...\n",
      "Ellie: Joel, watch out!\n",
      "Joel: Alright--\n",
      "Bill: Get off your ass and on your feet!\n",
      "Ellie: Wha--?\n",
      "Bill: Ah, goddammit! Back! Get back!\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, fuck!\n",
      "Joel: Which way?\n",
      "Bill: Alright -- we'll ah... We'll cut through. C'mon, here! Oh, goddamn.\n",
      "Ellie: I'm going.\n",
      "Bill: Where's that goddamn key?\n",
      "Ellie: Guys -- behind us!\n",
      "Joel: Bill, come on!\n",
      "Bill: Don't slow down. This place ain't secure.\n",
      "Bill: Alright, come on -- we're almost there. Follow me.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, shit.\n",
      "Bill: Goddammit! They're coming from all over! C'mon! They're gettin' through.\n",
      "Joel: Move, Ellie, move!\n",
      "Ellie: I'm going, I'm going!\n",
      "Bill: It's open, c'mon!\n",
      "Ellie: Man...that was close. Uh...thanks for the heroics and all.\n",
      "Ellie: Uh, Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, what are you-- Joel?\n",
      "Joel: Bill.\n",
      "Ellie: What are you doing?\n",
      "Joel: Bill!\n",
      "Ellie: Let me go!\n",
      "Bill: Turn around and get on your knees.\n",
      "Joel: Just calm down a second.\n",
      "Bill: Turn around and get on your knees!\n",
      "Joel: Alright!\n",
      "Bill: Don't test me!\n",
      "Joel: Just...ah, take it easy.\n",
      "Bill: You got any bites?\n",
      "Joel: No.\n",
      "Bill: Anything sprouting?\n",
      "Joel: No, goddammit, I'm clean!\n",
      "Bill: Well, I see so much as a twitch--\n",
      "Bill: Ow!\n",

      "Bill: Son of a bitch!\n",
      "Joel: You done?\n",
      "Bill: Am I done...? You come into my house, you set off all my traps, you damn\n",
      "Ellie: I am none of your goddamn business, and we're here because you owe Joel\n",
      "Bill: I owe Joel some favors, is this some kind of joke?\n",
      "Joel: I'll cut to the chase. I need a car.\n",
      "Bill: Well, it is a joke. Joel needs a car. Well, if I had one that works,\n",
      "Joel: By the looks of it, you could stand to lose some of that food.\n",
      "Bill: You listen to me, you little shit--\n",
      "Ellie: No, fuck you! You handcuffed me--\n",
      "Joel: I need you to shut up. Alright?\n",
      "Bill: Whatever favors you think I owe ya, it ain't worth that much.\n",
      "Joel: Actually, Bill, they are.\n",
      "Bill: Well, it don't matter 'cause I don't have a car that works.\n",
      "Joel: But there is one in this town.\n",
      "Bill: Parts. There are parts in this town.\n",
      "Joel: Meaning that you could fix one up.\n",
      "Bill: Alright. If I'm gonna do this, there's some gear I'm gonna need.\n",
      "Joel: Alright.\n",
      "Bill: It's on the other side of town. Now you help me go gather it, and maybe,\n",
      "Joel: That's fine.\n",
      "Joel: Couple days from now, we'll probably be dead anyway.\n",
      "Bill: Good. Follow me. Whole goddamn town's booby-trapped, best stay right on\n",
      "Ellie: Can't miss it.\n",
      "Joel: Knock it off.\n",
      "Bill: Alright. Whatever supplies you may want or need, I suggest you grab them.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, thank you. Ellie, take a look around and see if there's\n",
      "Ellie: Alrighty.\n",
      "Ellie: Man, he's got a fuckin' stick up his ass.\n",
      "Joel: Just...stay out of his way.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, you know how to play this?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah. Pretty badly, yeah.\n",
      "Ellie: I always wanted to learn.\n",
      "Bill: Hey, Bobby Fischer -- don't touch anything on that board!\n",
      "Ellie: Bobby what?\n",
      "Joel: Just let it go.\n",
      "Bill: Found everything you need?\n",
      "Joel: We're good. Alright, Ellie. Come on.\n",
      "Bill: Don't leave the door open.\n",
      "Joel: I got it.\n",
      "Bill: We have to cross to the other building. Up the stairs. Let's move it.\n",
      "Ellie: Psh.\n",
      "Joel: Just stay with me.\n",
      "Bill: Can't believe you agreed to this bullshit, Bill. What you shoulda done\n",
      "Ellie: You weren't kidding about him.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, he's one of a kind. I'm gonna take a look around up here.\n",
      "Bill: Nothin' in there that I need. Go ahead, take whatever you want.\n",
      "Joel: Thanks.\n",
      "Bill: So what kind of trouble are you in? Where the hell's Tess?\n",
      "Joel: It's a job. A simple drop-off.\n",
      "Bill: What are you delivering? That little brat?\n",
      "Ellie: Haha. Fuck you, too.\n",
      "Bill: Y'know, I hope you know what you're doin'.\n",
      "Ellie: Are you kidding me with this guy?\n",
      "Joel: So, where we goin', Bill?\n",
      "Bill: My other safehouse. It's more of an armory.\n",
      "Ellie: Wait, I thought we were gonna fix up a car?\n",
      "Bill: We? You know how to fix a--\n",
      "Joel: Bill, just...\n",
      "Bill: It's like I said, what I need is on the other side of town. Now, that\n",
      "Joel: Shhh. There's one inside\n",
      "Bill: Oh...I've been meaning to take care of that. Relax, it's nothin'. So\n",
      "Tess: She's busy.\n",
      "Bill: Yeah, sure...busy. Sounds to...me...like might be trouble in paradise.\n",
      "Ellie: Aw, gross.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, somethin' like that. \n",
      "Bill: Alright...here we go.\n",
      "Ellie: So...why don't you fix one of these cars?\n",
      "Bill: Oh my god, you're a genius. I mean the whole time, why on earth hadn't I\n",
      "Ellie: Okay...don't be a dick.\n",
      "Bill: Their tires are rotted and their batteries are dead.\n",
      "Ellie: Are you done?\n",
      "Bill: Can't even begin to think what the inside of the engine blocks look like.\n",
      "Joel: Goddammit.\n",
      "Ellie: Infected!\n",
      "Bill: Alright... You gotta check the barricades again. You neglect the simple\n",
      "Ellie: Okay, well now he's talking to himself.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah...Bill?\n",
      "Bill: Joel? This way.\n",
      "Bill: And up we go.\n",
      "Joel: You picked a hell of a place to hole up, didn't ya?\n",
      "Bill: You know, as bad as those things are, at least they're predictable. It's\n",
      "Ellie: What does that mean?\n",
      "Joel: Nothin'. You sure that gate's gonna hold 'em?\n",
      "Bill: Well, I locked it. They don't have a key.\n",
      "Joel: So, which way?\n",
      "Bill: We're here. It's in the cellar. Alright, down here.\n",
      "Bill: Well, here we are. You. Don't touch anything. And you close the door.\n",
      "Joel: Uh-uh.\n",
      "Ellie: What? I need a gun.\n",
      "Joel: No you don't.\n",
      "Ellie: Joel, I can handle myself.\n",
      "Joel: No. Just...stay here.\n",
      "Ellie: Fine. I'll just wait around for you two to get me killed.\n",
      "Bill: This goes on record as the worst fucking job you've ever taken.\n",
      "Joel: It's up there.\n",
      "Bill: How in the hell is Tess okay with this suicide mission?\n",
      "Joel: It's actually her idea.\n",
      "Bill: Really? Well, the broad's not as smart as I thought she was. But...fuck\n",
      "Joel: Bill, I can't just take her back.\n",
      "Bill: Then send her packing, let her find her own way. Let me tell you a story.\n",
      "Joel: Bill, it...it ain't like that. It's--\n",
      "Bill: Bullshit. It is just like that.\n",
      "Bill: Hey! What did I say to you when we walked down the steps? What did I say?\n",
      "Ellie: I'm just fixing your stupid pile.\n",
      "Bill: Don't touch!\n",
      "Bill: Goddamnit. You keep babysitting long enough and eventually it's gonna\n",
      "Joel: Bill. Can we please just get on with it?\n",
      "Bill: Here. Let's get on with it. Alright, before we go any further, I got\n",
      "Joel: Whatcha got?\n",
      "Bill: New toy from the toy box. This...is a nail bomb. You gotta be really\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, I've seen your handiwork.\n",
      "Bill: Pretty good, huh?\n",
      "Joel: So we got shotguns and bombs. What the hell are we doing with 'em?\n",
      "Bill: Well, every few weeks this military caravan rides through town. I assume\n",
      "Joel: So we take that battery and put it in another car.\n",
      "Bill: Bingo. I wanted to get it, but it seemed to dangerous with all the\n",
      "Joel: What if it's damaged?\n",
      "Bill: Nah. Those trucks are like tanks. It's just sittin' there.\n",
      "Joel: Actually might work.\n",
      "Bill: Kid, I swear to god...if you took anything--\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, man. I don't need any of your shit. Trust me.\n",
      "Bill: Joel, you are keeping an eye on her, right?\n",
      "Joel: Like a hawk.\n",
      "Ellie: Wow.\n",
      "Joel: Nice place you got here.\n",
      "Bill: Well, if you got anything to confess, this'd be the place to do it.\n",
      "Bill: That's not the confessional booth, that's my room.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, I'm not touchin' anything. Just...\n",
      "Bill: Alright...time to sack up.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie, c'mon.\n",
      "Bill: Look. There's the school.\n",
      "Joel: Alright.\n",
      "Bill: Ready?\n",
      "Joel: Guess we'll find out.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, man.\n",
      "Joel: C'mon, you don't need to be lookin' at that.\n",
      "Ellie: I've seen worse.\n",
      "Bill: Let's get a move on.\n",
      "Joel: Alright then.\n",
      "Bill: Past this gate, it's all new territory to me.\n",
      "Joel: I'm on it.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, hey. You guys hear that?\n",
      "Joel: Keep quiet.\n",
      "Joel: Ah, shit... Locked.\n",
      "Bill: Hold up. I got a key for that gate. I suggest we move quietly.\n",
      "Ellie: Runners!\n",
      "Joel: Easy, easy.\n",
      "Joel: You weren't kiddin' about this place, were ya?\n",
      "Ellie: If you guys would give me a gun, I could help you kill some of these\n",
      "Bill: Shut up. Just shut up.\n",
      "Joel: This way.\n",
      "Joel: It's tied on the other side.\n",
      "Ellie: What about going through here?\n",
      "Bill: What, the doggy door?\n",
      "Joel: Be very careful.\n",
      "Ellie: Of course.\n",
      "Bill: Maybe you should've given her a gun.\n",
      "Joel: Okay, Bill.\n",
      "Ellie: There's more of those clicker things inside the house.\n",
      "Bill: Oh, shit.\n",
      "Joel: They ain't seen us yet. Just stay down.\n",
      "Ellie: Careful.\n",
      "Bill: Alright, c'mon, let's get up. On the RV and over. We should be clear.\n",
      "Ellie: Who the hell left this here? You got friends in town?\n",
      "Bill: No. Although I have some idea who mighta come through here. School's on\n",
      "Joel: C'mon, Ellie. Alright, I think we're good.\n",
      "Bill: For now. Goddamn those things. Nobody's bitten, right?\n",
      "Ellie: Nope. I'm good.\n",
      "Joel: We're all fine. Let's just keep going.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, you got a second?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah?\n",
      "Ellie: I...I just want to say I'm sorry. About Tess. That's it. I won't bring\n",
      "Joel: Ellie, you don't need to worry about me. We should go check on Bill.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Bill: Hey, Joel!\n",
      "Joel: Yeah?\n",
      "Bill: Gimme a hand with this.\n",
      "Bill: What'd I tell ya. There's that truck, sticking outta the school right\n",
      "Bill: Well, that was easier than I thought it'd be. They must be holed up\n",
      "Joel: Well, let's not test our luck. How do we get inside?\n",
      "Ellie: Someone left a ladder on the bus. Here, get me up there and I'll drop\n",
      "Bill: Don't get killed up there.\n",
      "Ellie: Thanks, Bill.\n",
      "Bill: We're okay. We just need to get to the hood of the truck. Shit. You hear\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, fuck. They're piling over this fence over here. It's not gonna hold!\n",
      "Bill: The door's locked!\n",
      "Joel: Go, go, go, you two! Go!\n",
      "Ellie: Joel!\n",
      "Joel: Shit.\n",
      "Bill: Alright, come on!\n",
      "Ellie: That's not gonna hold.\n",
      "Joel: Bill, make it fast! Grab this.\n",
      "Joel: Please tell me you're done!\n",
      "Bill: It's empty.\n",
      "Joel: What?\n",
      "Bill: It's fuckin' empty!\n",
      "Ellie: Guys!\n",
      "Joel: Bill, where to?\n",
      "Bill: Uh.\n",
      "Joel: Bill, where?!\n",
      "Bill: Anywhere but here.\n",
      "Joel: Get ready to haul ass. C'mon.\n",
      "Bill: They've broken through!\n",
      "Bill: Let's, um... We'll sneak out the back.\n",
      "Joel: You two, follow me. I'll get us outta here.\n",
      "Bill: Be my guest.\n",
      "Bill: There's a way through. We gotta make it past these guys.\n",
      "Joel: Help me open this.\n",
      "Bill: Alright. Ready? One more time.\n",
      "Joel: C'mon.\n",
      "Bill: Shit. There's more on the way. Barricade the doors.\n",
      "Bill: This ain't gonna hold them for long.\n",

      "Bill: You ain't gonna make it. Oh, oh, ah... Here.\n",
      "Joel: What's this?\n",
      "Bill: You'd be amazed at how many cars still got gas in 'em.\n",

      "Ellie: Well...\n",
      "Ellie: Here. This make you all nostalgic?\n",
      "Joel: Y'know, this is actually before my time. That is a winner though.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, man...\n",
      "Ellie: Well, better than nothing. Oh, I'm sure \"your friend\" will be missing\n",
      "Joel: Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Ellie: Light on the reading, but it's got some interesting photos.\n",
      "Joel: Now, Ellie, that ain't for kids.\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa. How...how the hell would he even walk around with that thing?\n",
      "Joel: Get rid of that. Just--\n",
      "Ellie: Hold your horses. I wanna see what all the fuss is about. Oh...why are\n",
      "Joel: Um...\n",
      "Ellie: I'm just fucking with you. Bye-bye, dude.\n",
      "Ellie: You know what? This isn't that bad.\n",
      "Joel: Why don't you try and get some sleep, alright?\n",
      "Ellie: Pft -- I'm not even tired.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, no, no, no, no. Well, perfect.\n",
      "Ellie: Now what?\n",

      "Ellie: Easy.\n",
      "Man: Please...help...\n",
      "Ellie: Holy shit... Are we going to help him?\n",
      "Joel: Put your seat belt on, Ellie.\n",
      "Man: Help me...\n",
      "Ellie: What about the guy?\n",
      "Joel: Oh, he ain't even hurt.\n",
      "Man: Oh, fuck! Go, go, go!\n",
      "Ellie: Jesus. Oh, not good!\n",
      "Joel: Hold on!\n",
      "Ellie: I'm okay. I'm okay.\n",
      "Joel: Then get out quick.\n",
      "Hunter: C'mere, you!\n",
      "Joel: Shit!\n",
      "Ellie: Let go of me, you chickenshit! Joel!\n",
      "Hunter: I'll show you. I'll show you.\n",
      "Ellie: Get off of me!\n",
      "Ellie: Motherfucker.\n",
      "Joel: Come on.\n",
      "Ellie: What's wrong with these guys?\n",
      "Joel: Catch your breath. We're leaving.\n",
      "Ellie: 'Kay... Watch out!\n",
      "Joel: Shit! Stay down!\n",
      "Hunter: This motherfucker's dangerous. He killed all of them.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Shit. Spread out.\n",
      "Hunter 3: Damn. This tourist got some scrap in him.\n",
      "Joel: Alright...I think that's the last of 'em. You OK?\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah. I guess so.\n",
      "Joel: Good, 'cause we need to get the hell out of here. You know the drill.\n",
      "Ellie: Roger that. Agh. Hey -- maybe we can go through here.\n",
      "Joel: Well, we sure as hell ain't going back this way. Aggh...c'mon...Alright,\n",
      "Ellie: Um... There's some pretty gnarly stuff in here.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie!\n",
      "Ellie: Right. Okay, go.\n",
      "Joel: Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.\n",
      "Ellie: Look.\n",
      "Joel: Fucking hunters. See, this could've been us.\n",
      "Ellie: Man, that is a lot of people that didn't make it.\n",
      "Joel: I knew I should've turned the damn truck around.\n",
      "Ellie: We lived.\n",
      "Joel: Barely. C'mon, let's get outta here.\n",
      "Ellie: How did you know?\n",
      "Joel: Know what?\n",
      "Ellie: About the ambush.\n",
      "Joel: I've been on both sides.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh. So, ah, you kill a lot of innocent people?\n",
      "Ellie: I'll take that as a yes.\n",
      "Joel: Take it however you want.\n",
      "Ellie: I guess this is where the assholes sleep. I mean slept.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, I don't think these guys were infected.\n",
      "Joel: It don't matter. Let's just keep moving.\n",
      "Joel: Hey, Ellie, slow down. Wait for me.\n",
      "Ellie: What? I'm right here.\n",
      "Joel: How 'bout you let me go first? And keep your voice down.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Ellie: I'm whistling.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, good. Something else you can annoy me with.\n",
      "Ellie: That's awesome.\n",
      "Ellie: What happened here? Your fellow hunters do this?\n",
      "Joel: Cute. And no, my money's on the military.\n",
      "Ellie: Why would they mow down all these people?\n",
      "Joel: Can't let everyone in.\n",
      "Ellie: So they killed them?\n",
      "Joel: And dead people don't get infected. You sacrifice the few to save the\n",
      "Ellie: It's kinda shitty.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah.\n",
      "Ellie: What was that?\n",
      "Joel: I don't know. Ellie, get down.\n",
      "Hunter: Where did you learn to shoot?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Man, screw you.\n",
      "Hunter: You had an entire flock and hit nothing.\n",
      "Hunter 2: I'm about to hit you.\n",
      "Hunter: Wow...yeah, you're really upset. Well if you want some lessons, I'm\n",
      "Hunter 2: Yeah, whatever.\n",
      "Hunter 3: Where the hell are those guys? They're supposed to be here.\n",
      "Hunter: They're on the highway shift. Wouldn't be surprised if they caught\n",
      "Hunter 3: Spot's a goldmine. Lucky bastards.\n",
      "Hunter: See if there's anything you can forage while we wait for them.\n",
      "Hunter 3: Ain't nothin' here. Let's keep going.\n",
      "Hunter: Screw this. I ain't waiting any longer. Let's go see what those\n",
      "Hunter 2: They pull this crap every time. I swear to god, if they're holding\n",
      "Hunter: Yeah. And you'll do what?\n",
      "Hunter 2: You'll see.\n",
      "Hunter: Yeah, I will see.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, we can climb the bus right here. Okay, we need to lighten the\n",
      "Joel: What is that?\n",
      "Ellie: A joke book. No Pun Intended: Volume Too by Will Livingston.\n",
      "Joel: Let's keep going.\n",
      "Ellie: \"What did the Confederate soldiers use to eat off of? Civil ware.\"\n",
      "Joel: Uh-huh.\n",
      "Ellie: \"What did they use to drink with? Cups. Dixie cups.\" \"I walked into my\n",
      "Joel: That's awful.\n",
      "Ellie: You're awful.\n",
      "Joel: Do you even understand what that means?\n",
      "Ellie: Nope. Doesn't matter. Alright, I'm done...for now.\n",
      "Ellie: That bridge looks pretty far.\n",
      "Joel: We'll get there.\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa. It's strange seeing a checkpoint with no soldiers.\n",
      "Joel: This is what most zones look like. This place has been abandoned for a\n",
      "Ellie: \"Give us our rations.\" Why wouldn't they give them their food?\n",
      "Joel: Sometimes they ran out. Most times they just held onto it.\n",
      "Ellie: That never happened in Boston.\n",
      "Joel: Trust me, it happened all the time.\n",
      "Ellie: I hear hunters.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, me too. Let's keep it down while we're going through this area.\n",
      "Hunter: Oh...I'm so fucking tired. We were up all night chasing this tourist.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Oh, you were part of that? I heard about this.\n",
      "Hunter: Yeah, this one chick, she would just not give up. I've never seen\n",
      "Hunter 2: Jesus. Sometimes you gotta earn your keep.\n",
      "Hunter: Yeah, I guess. We were about to give up when she started shooting at\n",
      "Hunter 2: Damn. Maybe you shoulda kept her. Y'know, made her one of us.\n",
      "Hunter: No, no way. That girl -- she'd a killed us all in our sleep.\n",
      "Hunter 3: Bossman says we're getting big enough to expand.\n",
      "Hunter 4: New head honcho...same bullshit talk.\n",
      "Hunter 3: I don't know. Now that we have enough people watching all the exits,\n",
      "Hunter 4: What is that really gonna give us?\n",
      "Hunter 3 : I don't know, maybe we find some more gas, get some more generators\n",
      "Hunter 4: That shit ain't happening. I've heard that expansion talk way too\n",
      "Hunter 3: How do you know? Maybe things'll be different now.\n",
      "Hunter 4: Keep your expectations in check, youngun. You'll live longer.\n",
      "Joel: That was too damn close.\n",
      "Ellie: The edge of the universe and back. Endure and survive.\n",
      "Joel: Excuse me?\n",
      "Ellie: Savage Starlight. That comic I've been reading? It's what the hero says\n",
      "Joel: Endure and survive?\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah.\n",
      "Joel: Okay.\n",
      "Ellie: Man, look at all these books. I wish I had more room in my backpack.\n",
      "Joel: So you're a reader, huh?\n",
      "Ellie: Well, when I'm not running away from hunters or infected? Yeah, I read\n",
      "Joel: I get it.\n",
      "Ellie: \"A moon rock tastes better than an earthly rock...because it's meteor.\"\n",
      "Joel: Do you even get that?\n",
      "Ellie: Of course not. \"I used to be addicted to soap, but I'm clean now.\"\n",
      "Joel: Alright, I've actually never heard that one.\n",
      "Ellie: That's it...that's all I got. Now what?\n",
      "Ellie: Man, you'd gotta be crazy to string up soldiers.\n",
      "Joel: You get people desperate enough, they'll do just about anything.\n",
      "Ellie: And the people that rose up...they're the ones we've been fighting here?\n",
      "Joel: That'd be my bet. Let's see where this leads us. Watch yourself on these\n",
      "Joel: Down, down, down, down. There's more of 'em.\n",
      "Hunter: Careful with that plank.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Let's get outta here.\n",
      "Joel: Alright. I don't think they saw us.\n",
      "Ellie: Whew. There's our bridge. We're a little closer, I think.\n",
      "Joel: Let's keep at it. C'mon.\n",
      "Ellie: That girl is so skinny. I thought you had plenty of food in your time.\n",
      "Joel: We did. Some just chose to not eat it.\n",
      "Ellie: Why the hell not?\n",
      "Joel: For looks.\n",
      "Ellie: Pssh. That's stupid.\n",
      "Ellie: I think we can use some good ol' pun humor. \"3.14% of sailors are pi\n",

      "Ellie: Okay. I'm all joked out.\n",
      "Joel: I can't make that jump.\n",
      "Ellie: If you get me up there, I can move that plank.\n",
      "Joel: Wait here! Let's see where this goes.\n",
      "Joel: What the hell? Oh, this place is bad.\n",
      "Ellie: What the hell was that all about?\n",
      "Joel: Get on. We're cuttin' through the hotel.\n",
      "Ellie: Um...okay...\n",
      "Joel: Set that plank like they did.\n",

      "Hunter 3: Hey, how 'bout we take a little food break?\n",
      "Hunter 4: Nah, maybe in like an hour or so. We can eat something before heading\n",
      "Hunter 3: Sounds good.\n",

      "Ellie: Just tell me where to go.\n",
      "Joel: I hate this crap.\n",
      "Ellie: Wow, look at that.\n",
      "Joel: That's a backdrop. People would take their pictures in front of it.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, I know what it is.\n",
      "Joel: Okay, then. Something on your mind, Ellie?\n",
      "Ellie: I wasn't trying to disobey you back there. You were taking a really\n",
      "Joel: It don't matter what you thought. I need you to listen to me.\n",
      "Ellie: I do. It's just that... Whatever, Joel.\n",
      "Joel: That door looks like a way out. Hey, you see a way to get up there?\n",
      "Ellie: Nope.\n",
      "Joel: Might be able to get through with this. Alright... Goddamn, this is\n",
      "Ellie: You sure you can trust me with that?\n",
      "Joel: Ellie... Push.\n",
      "Ellie: I am.\n",
      "Joel: Push harder!\n",
      "Ellie: There. How's that?\n",
      "Joel: Let's go.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, shit.\n",
      "Hunter: They haven't gotten back yet. What the hell's taking them so long?\n",
      "Hunter 2: I don't know. They went to check on 'em. For now, we wait.\n",
      "Joel: C'mere, keep your head down. Alright now...I'm gonna jump down there and\n",
      "Ellie: What about me?\n",
      "Joel: You stay here.\n",
      "Ellie: This is so stupid. We'd have more of a fucking chance if you'd let me\n",
      "Joel: I am.\n",
      "Joel: Now you seem to know your way around a gun. You reckon you can handle\n",
      "Ellie: Well, uh, I sorta shot a rifle before...but it was a rats.\n",
      "Joel: Rats?\n",
      "Ellie: With BBs.\n",
      "Joel: Well, it's the same basic concept. Lift it up. Alright now, you're gonna\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Joel: Go ahead and pull the bolt back. Grab it right there. Just tug it. There\n",
      "Ellie: I got this.\n",
      "Joel: Alright. And just so we're clear about back there...it was either him or\n",
      "Ellie: You're welcome.\n",
      "Hunter: Asshole should've known better. If you're gonna steal, you better make\n",
      "Hunter 2: Right? I would've done--\n",
      "Hunter 3: They're all dead! They're all fucking dead!\n",
      "Hunter: The hell's he yappin' about? Take a breath. Who's dead?\n",
      "Hunter 3: The whole crew. The 76 lookout guys. Some fuckin' tourist killed 'em,\n",
      "Hunter: Shit. Have you talked to the boss?\n",
      "Hunter 3: Yeah. He wants everyone to hold their ground, watch the gate.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Alright, you heard him. Search the area. Do not let anybody through!\n",
      "Hunter 4: He's gotta be wrong.\n",
      "Hunter 5: About the crew being dead?\n",
      "Hunter 4: I don't see some tourists taking out the entire crew.\n",
      "Hunter 5: What if they did? Maybe it's the military coming back.\n",
      "Hunter 4: Don't be an idiot. Military doesn't give a damn about this place.\n",
      "Hunter 5: We'll find them. We always do.\n",
      "Hunter 4: I hope you're right.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, come on down.\n",
      "Ellie: How'd I do?\n",
      "Joel: How 'bout something a...little more your size.\n",
      "Joel: It's for emergencies only.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Joel: Now, the safety's on. Do you know how to switch it off?\n",
      "Ellie: I do.\n",
      "Joel: Okay, you just...you gotta respect it. This is not--\n",
      "Ellie: Joel, I'll be careful.\n",
      "Joel: Okay.\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa, nelly. Harsh punishment.\n",
      "Joel: Shit. It ain't that much different from what the military does back in\n",
      "Ellie: I guess not.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, do your thing, Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: On it. Come on. Stupid chain is stuck. Hold on.\n",
      "Joel: I am.\n",
      "Ellie: There.\n",
      "Joel: That's good thinkin'.\n",
      "Ellie: How 'bout you get me up there?\n",
      "Joel: Help me open this.\n",
      "Ellie: Here.\n",
      "Joel: I got it.\n",
      "Voice: Run!\n",
      "Joel: Oh shit, get down, get down.\n",
      "Voice: Keep running!\n",
      "Ellie: What do we do?\n",
      "Joel: Nothing.\n",
      "Dying Woman: No...\n",
      "Hunter: Busy couple a days, huh?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Whatever, man. Damn. No food, old pair of shoes. They got nothin'.\n",
      "Hunter: Alright.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh man...\n",
      "Joel: There ain't nothin' we coulda done.\n",
      "Ellie: I know...it's just...oh man.\n",
      "Joel: Let's just get to that bridge.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Hunter: Well, at least they finally killed that couple. I was sure they made\n",
      "Hunter 2: There better've been an army in that truck. How the fuck did they\n",
      "Hunter: Let's keep searching. I wanna wrap this up by sundown.\n",
      "Hunter: Got word from the east side crew -- they ain't seen shit.\n",
      "Hunter 2: What about Market Street?\n",
      "Hunter: Yeah, they're driving through that area now. Who knows, maybe they'll\n",
      "Hunter 2: I pray to god these tourists show their faces.\n",
      "Hunter: Fuck, they gotta show up somewhere...I think this'll be your lucky day.\n",
      "Ellie: Joel, there's a guy up on that second floor, right there.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, I see him. Stay low.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh man. Endure and survive.\n",
      "Joel: What? Oh, right...the comic book thing.\n",
      "Ellie: Geez. I guess this is how it ended for this zone.\n",
      "Joel: Well, every battle's got a losing side.\n",
      "Ellie: What if they had families?\n",
      "Joel: Everyone has a family. Best not to dwell on it.\n",
      "Ellie: How can you not? Hey -- get me up there. Come on.\n",
      "Joel: There ya go.\n",
      "Joel: We're almost there.\n",
      "Ellie: I stayed at a place like this. Back in the Boston QZ.\n",
      "Joel: \"Military Preparatory School\".\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, nice way of saying orphanage. I wonder what happened to all these\n",
      "Joel: This place has been out for a good stretch. They ain't kids no more.\n",
      "Ellie: Meaning they're either hunters trying to kill us, or they're dead.\n",
      "Joel: Or they got away.\n",
      "Ellie: But you don't believe that?\n",
      "Joel: I believe in getting out of this city. Come on.\n",
      "Ellie: There's another one.\n",
      "Ellie: These posters are everywhere.\n",
      "Joel: I saw this right before the outbreak.\n",
      "Ellie: You did? Did he totally gut her by the end?\n",
      "Joel: Nobody gets gutted. It's a dumb teen movie.\n",
      "Ellie: Who dragged you to see it then?\n",
      "Joel: I don't know. Let's just stay focused, alright?\n",
      "Ellie: Alright.\n",
      "Joel: Let's get through the alley.\n",
      "Ellie: Agh, it's that fucking truck.\n",
      "Joel: It's alright, keep your head down.\n",
      "Hunter: Six.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Nope.\n",
      "Hunter: Seven.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Not even close.\n",
      "Hunter: Ten.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Keep going.\n",
      "Hunter: I don't know, twenty.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Try twenty-five.\n",
      "Hunter: Bullshit.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Swear to god.\n",
      "Hunter: You have twenty-five cans of bacon?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Well, twenty-four. I just finished one.\n",
      "Hunter: How the hell do you have twenty-four cans of bacon?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Military locker in the hotel, from back in the day. Me and Reuben\n",
      "Hunter: And that shit's still good? When are you making some more?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Why?\n",
      "Hunter: Why do you think? I want some.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Yeah, I bet you do.\n",
      "Hunter: Man...I saved your ass from that clicker last week.\n",
      "Hunter 2: I'll think about it.\n",
      "Hunter: I shoulda let your ass die back there.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Oh, Jesus. I'll make you some if you quit bringing that up.\n",
      "Hunter: It better be as good as you say it is.\n",
      "Hunter 2: It's bacon; of course it's good.\n",
      "Ellie: What the fuck are they shooting at us with?\n",
      "Joel: I think we lost 'em.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh shit.\n",
      "Joel: We're okay. They can't see us.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, shit.\n",
      "Man: What the fuck?\n",
      "Joel: Sonofa--\n",
      "Ellie: Joel.\n",
      "Man: Wait. Wait!\n",
      "Ellie: Joel, stop! Look.\n",
      "Man: Leave him alone.\n",
      "Joel: Easy, on. Just take it easy.\n",
      "Man: It's alright. They're not the bad guys. Lower the gun. Man, you hit hard.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, well, I was trying to kill you.\n",
      "Man: Yeah, I thought you were one of them too. Then I saw you. If you haven't\n",
      "Kid: You're bleeding.\n",
      "Man: Ah, it's nothing.\n",
      "Henry: I'm Henry. This is Sam. I think I caught your name was Joel?\n",
      "Ellie: Ellie.\n",
      "Joel: How many are with you?\n",
      "Sam: They're all dead.\n",
      "Henry: Hey, we don't know that. There were a bunch of us. Someone had the\n",
      "Ellie: We can help each other.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: Safety in numbers and all that.\n",
      "Henry: She's right. We could help each other. We got a hideout not too far\n",
      "Joel: Alright, take us there.\n",
      "Henry: Follow me.\n",
      "Sam: Sorry about the whole gun thing.\n",
      "Ellie: Don't worry. I would've probably done the same thing. Where you from?\n",
      "Sam: All the way from Hartford.\n",
      "Ellie: Really? I heard some bad stuff going on down there.\n",
      "Sam: Yeah, the military abandoned the zone. It's why we left. Place probably\n",
      "Henry: We gotta be careful. We're right next to one of their lookout areas. Is\n",
      "Ellie: We're not related, we're more like, um...\n",
      "Joel: I promised someone I'd look after her.\n",
      "Henry: Yeah, I can appreciate that.\n",
      "Henry: Wait, wait. Everyone be quiet. Get away from the windows.\n",
      "Joel: They're gone.\n",
      "Henry: Man...that fuckin' truck. It's been hounding us ever since we got in\n",
      "Sam: Nothing.\n",
      "Henry: Get rid of it.\n",
      "Sam: My backpack is practically empty.\n",
      "Henry: What's the rule about takin' stuff?\n",
      "Sam: It weighs like nothing.\n",
      "Henry: The rule -- what is it?\n",
      "Sam: We only take what we have to.\n",
      "Henry: That's right. Now come on.\n",
      "Joel: How far is this place?\n",
      "Henry: We're close. Real close.\n",
      "Joel: Shit. Ellie, you watch our back.\n",
      "Ellie: Of course.\n",
      "Henry: Sam, stay with her.\n",
      "Hunter: What'd you find?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Nothing... Looks like someone was up there, but they're long gone.\n",
      "Hunter: So where are the others?\n",
      "Hunter 2: They wanted to give it another once over. Make sure we didn't miss\n",
      "Hunter: Alright...keep an eye out over there. I'll check this area.\n",
      "Henry: We did it. Not bad, old timer. Come on, up on this truck. Oh shit,\n",
      "Henry: Through this door.\n",
      "Joel: Are you sure it's safe being so close to them?\n",
      "Henry: I'm the only one with the key, man.\n",
      "Joel: And where'd you get that?\n",
      "Henry: I killed one of 'em. He won't miss it now. Everybody through.\n",
      "Sam: It's back here. So...how old are you?\n",
      "Ellie: Me? Fourteen. How old are you?\n",
      "Sam: Ah...the same.\n",
      "Henry: Oh, you're fourteen, huh?\n",
      "Sam: I'm close.\n",
      "Henry: Alright.\n",
      "Sam: I am.\n",
      "Henry: Here we are. Welcome to my office.\n",
      "Ellie: How long have you guys been holed up in here?\n",
      "Sam: A few days. We found a bit of food, though. Here.\n",
      "Henry: Blueberries. Found a whole stash of 'em. You want some?\n",
      "Joel: No.\n",
      "Henry: Hey, man, relax. We're safe.\n",
      "Joel: So why haven't you left?\n",
      "Henry: Been waiting for the right opportunity.\n",
      "Joel: And?\n",
      "Henry: Here. Check this out.\n",
      "Henry: Look at these sons of bitches. Everyday they congregate down there,\n",
      "Joel: That could work.\n",
      "Henry: Oh, it'll work. It'll definitely work. Wow...\n",
      "Sam: Ready?\n",
      "Ellie: Ow.\n",
      "Sam: A blueberry hurt you?\n",
      "Henry: It's been awhile since that boy even cracked a smile. She doesn't seem\n",
      "Joel: So where were you headin'?\n",
      "Henry: Heard the Fireflies are based out west somewhere. We're gonna join up\n",
      "Joel: Yeah...\n",
      "Henry: Somethin' funny?\n",
      "Joel: Just seems like there's a lot of people putting their stock on the\n",
      "Henry: Yeah, maybe there's a reason for that.\n",
      "Joel: So you don't know where they are and you're just gonna drag him across\n",
      "Henry: I tell you what, how about I worry about my brother and you worry about\n",
      "Joel: Easy. We're looking for the Fireflies too.\n",
      "Henry: This is us. There's an abandoned military radio station, just outside\n",
      "Joel: I guess we best rest up then.\n",
      "Ellie: He says it's time to go.\n",
      "Henry: Now, we're gonna be moving fast, okay? So no matter what, you stick to\n",
      "Sam: Like glue. Got it.\n",
      "Henry: Like glue. Good, good. Alright, y'all ready?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah.\n",
      "Henry: Okay. Alright, y'all stay close, okay?\n",
      "Joel: You tried this before?\n",
      "Henry: Uh, yeah.\n",
      "Joel: That's comforting.\n",
      "Henry: Relax, old man.\n",
      "Joel: I just hope you know the way.\n",
      "Henry: This way.\n",
      "Henry: Okay, let's try to take them out quietly. Hey, I'll follow your lead.\n",
      "Joel: Alright.\n",
      "Hunter: Hey...how you doing?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Just trying to keep warm. How's it looking out there?\n",
      "Hunter: We put down some infected, but no sign of those tourists.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Think they're still in the city?\n",
      "Hunter: Yeah, they're still around. Alright...I'm gonna do another round.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Yeah, you too.\n",
      "Hunter: Hey, you hear that? Clicker.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Yeah, I hear it, but I don't see shit! Woo! Nailed it! Did you see\n",
      "Hunter: Not bad. Hold up, there it is! There!\n",
      "Henry: Yo, Joel, there's a guy on that light up there.\n",
      "Joel: I see 'em.\n",
      "Henry: Alright, we did it.\n",
      "Joel: Henry, give me a hand with this.\n",
      "Henry: Alright. You ready?\n",
      "Henry: Ah, shit. Go!\n",
      "Joel: Oh, no. Hurry, c'mon.\n",
      "Henry: Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "Hunter: Hey! They're over here!\n",
      "Henry: Got 'em. Come on, everyone.\n",
      "Joel: Keep your eyes open, we ain't outta this mess yet.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, check it out.\n",
      "Henry: We're good. Sam, let's go.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, kid, c'mon. There you go.\n",
      "Henry: Come on.\n",
      "Hunter: Open the gate!\n",
      "Henry: Ah, shit!\n",
      "Joel: Hurry, hurry!\n",
      "Hunter 2: They locked it!\n",
      "Joel: Ellie!\n",
      "Henry: Gotcha.\n",
      "Hunter: Go!\n",
      "Hunter 2: Move outta the fucking way! We gotta ram it!\n",
      "Ellie: Okay, we gotta get him up.\n",
      "Henry: Ah...I'm sorry. We're leaving.\n",
      "Sam: What?\n",
      "Ellie: What? This is bullshit!\n",
      "Hunter: Hey! Now!\n",
      "Ellie: What the fuck, Henry?\n",
      "Joel: Oh shit.\n",
      "Ellie: We stick together.\n",
      "Hunter: One more time. Punch it!\n",
      "Joel: C'mon, into the building! Let's go!\n",
      "Ellie: Okay! Okay...\n",
      "Joel: Go...\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, fuck.\n",
      "Hunter: Go around to the other side!\n",
      "Ellie: Agh. How the fuck do we get outta here?\n",
      "Hunter: The hell is going on back there?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Sounds like they found 'em. Spread out. They might come through here.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, let's get underneath it.\n",
      "Hunter: Fuckin' open it! Go! There! They're running to the bridge! Go, go, go!\n",
      "Ellie: Joel!\n",
      "Joel: Oh, shit.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, fuck.\n",
      "Joel: How many bullets do you have left?\n",
      "Ellie: They're gonna kill us.\n",
      "Joel: What other choice do we have?\n",
      "Ellie: We jump.\n",
      "Joel: No, it's too high and you can't swim. I'll boost you up, you run past\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, shit.\n",
      "Joel: Oh my god.\n",
      "Ellie: You'll keep me afloat.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: No time to argue.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie! Ah, damn it!\n",
      "Ellie: Joel!\n",
      "Joel: I got you! No, no, no, no...\n",
      "Sam: Henry! He's awake.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, you. We're alive. Okay.\n",
      "Henry: See? What'd I tell you, huh? He's good. Everything's fine. You know,\n",
      "Henry: What the fuck's wrong with you?\n",
      "Sam: Henry!\n",
      "Joel: Get back, son!\n",
      "Henry: It's fine! Hey, hey, hey, hey... He's pissed but he's not gonna do\n",
      "Joel: You sure about that?\n",
      "Sam: Stop!\n",
      "Ellie: Joel.\n",
      "Joel: He left us to die out there.\n",
      "Henry: No. You had a good chance of making it, and you did. But coming back\n",
      "Ellie: He saved me too. We woulda drowned.\n",
      "Henry: It's fine though. I'm okay. Y'know, for what it's worth, I'm really\n",
      "Ellie: That was intense. You cool?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah. Let's go find that radio tower.\n",
      "Ellie: For a second there, I thought you might shoot him.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah...almost did.\n",
      "Ellie: They're alright. I think it's good to have 'em around.\n",
      "Joel: I think you're right.\n",
      "Sam: Um, do you trust him?\n",
      "Henry: Yeah, I do. Hey, don't worry about it. We're fine now, okay?\n",
      "Sam: Yeah.\n",
      "Henry: You gotta believe me on this, Sam, alright?\n",
      "Sam: Sure.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, maybe we can find something in that boat over there.\n",
      "Henry: Keep your eyes peeled!\n",
      "Joel: Way ahead of you, kid.\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa.\n",
      "Joel: What?\n",
      "Ellie: First time on a boat.\n",
      "Joel: Well, it's a little bit different in the water.\n",
      "Ellie: One step at a time.\n",
      "Sam: Hey, Ellie. I think we found something!\n",
      "Ellie: Let's go see what it is.\n",
      "Henry: Hey, I bet this goes all the way through. Gimme a hand with this.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, same time. Come on.\n",
      "Henry: Let's do it.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, c'mon, kids, go.\n",
      "Henry: Alright. Here we go.\n",
      "Joel: You go in.\n",
      "Henry: Okay.\n",
      "Henry: Hey, flashlights out. Sam, stay--\n",
      "Sam: Stay close, I know.\n",
      "Henry: Someone's finally learning.\n",
      "Ellie: See anything?\n",
      "Joel: Uh-huh. Gotta find a different way.\n",
      "Ellie: Joel, we should see what's over here.\n",
      "Joel: It's blocked.\n",
      "Ellie: If you can get it open, I can crawl through and clear that door. Oh,\n",
      "Ellie: Do you think they'll join us all the way to Tommy's?\n",
      "Joel: Well, I don't know. We're just gonna have to see how everything pans out.\n",
      "Henry: This way. Yeah, looks like there's a path up ahead. Right here.\n",
      "Sam: Can we get out this way?\n",
      "Sam: Well, I can't swim.\n",
      "Ellie: That makes two of us.\n",
      "Henry: Alright, Joel, how do we get across?\n",
      "Joel: Guess we gotta figure somethin' out.\n",
      "Henry: Hey, this thing's on some kinda track. Maybe there's a way we can use\n",
      "Ellie: Look, a generator.\n",
      "Henry: It's jammed!\n",
      "Joel: Henry, give it a shot!\n",
      "Henry: Alright! Here we go. Yep -- it's working!\n",
      "Joel: I'll go have a look. You keep an eye out.\n",
      "Henry: Joel! You okay?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah! Still in one piece.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh -- this thing again.\n",
      "Henry: Oh, there you go. That's smart.\n",
      "Ellie: Ahh, I can't wait to get outta this place.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, see if that generator's still got some juice.\n",
      "Ellie: Here goes nothin'. Alright!\n",
      "Sam: Huh. I can't believe that actually worked.\n",
      "Henry: Yeah, don't jinx us.\n",
      "Henry: I gotta say, I'm impressed with you two.\n",
      "Ellie: Pssh...we're pros at this by now.\n",
      "Ellie: Uh...what's up with this?\n",
      "Sam: You think there's people inside?\n",
      "Henry: Maybe.\n",
      "Ellie: Are we really going in there?\n",
      "Joel: Oh shit.\n",
      "Henry: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\n",
      "Sam: It's a sound trap.\n",
      "Ellie: A what?\n",
      "Joel: It's a sort of alarm.\n",
      "Ellie: I don't hear anything.\n",
      "Joel: Someone used to live here. Don't look like that's the case anymore.\n",
      "Sam: Who would stay in here?\n",
      "Henry: Well, someone who thought they could keep a place like this safe.\n",
      "Joel: Ugh.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, awesome.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie, don't--\n",
      "Ellie: Ah, calm down. Sam, stand by those posts over there. Yeah.\n",
      "Sam: Okay.\n",
      "Ellie: Ready?\n",
      "Sam: Oh, Henry, did you see that?\n",
      "Henry: Let's keep it down, buddy, okay?\n",
      "Sam: Yeah. Sorry.\n",
      "Ellie: You hear that? Infected.\n",
      "Joel: Shh, shhh. Quiet.\n",
      "Henry: There's three more heading our way!\n",
      "Ellie: Well, I guess we know what happened to these people.\n",
      "Joel: Seeing as how there was a clicker, they must've been gone for awhile.\n",
      "Henry: We keep moving forward. All we can do is hope that there aren't any\n",
      "Ellie: Hey. You think that leads out?\n",
      "Henry: Could be. It's too high for a boost. Maybe there's another way to get\n",
      "Joel: Oh shit. Get back!\n",
      "Ellie: What?\n",
      "Henry: Sam!\n",
      "Sam: Yeah, I'm cool.\n",
      "Joel: That was me. I must've triggered some sort of safety gate or somethin'.\n",
      "Ellie: So...this is awkward.\n",
      "Sam: Yeah, I know. It's like every time--\n",
      "Ellie: Clickers!\n",
      "Joel: What?\n",
      "Henry: Hey, this thing isn't budging, man.\n",
      "Joel: Just go, get outta here.\n",
      "Henry: Sam, you stay close to him.\n",
      "Ellie: Henry, we gotta fucking move!\n",
      "Henry: You keep him safe!\n",
      "Joel: Go! Shh, shh, shh.\n",
      "Joel: We're gonna be fine.\n",
      "Henry: Yeah, yeah I know.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, come on, kid. See if we can find a way outta here, yeah?\n",
      "Henry: Okay.\n",
      "Sam: You did it.\n",
      "Joel: We're gonna keep going. You good?\n",
      "Sam: Yeah. I bet there were a lot of them here. People, I mean.\n",
      "Joel: Looks like it.\n",
      "Sam: Look at this place. It's like a classroom. Why couldn't they keep it safe?\n",
      "Joel: Son, I wish I knew. God knows they didn't deserve it. You think you can\n",
      "Sam: Yeah.\n",
      "Joel: Go ahead.\n",
      "Sam: There we go.\n",
      "Joel: Good job, kid.\n",
      "Ellie: Fucking thing!\n",
      "Sam: Is that Ellie?\n",
      "Joel: C'mon.\n",
      "Sam: Joel, that's them.\n",
      "Henry: Sam!\n",
      "Ellie: Oh thank god. We gotta keep running.\n",
      "Henry: Doorway -- over there! Sam!\n",
      "Ellie: Run! There's too many of 'em!\n",
      "Joel: Ellie! Get away from the door!\n",
      "Henry: Maybe if we push it together.\n",
      "Ellie: Sam! He just crawled through!\n",
      "Henry: He what? Sam, what the hell are you doin'?\n",
      "Sam: Getting us outta here!\n",
      "Henry: Well, hurry up then!\n",
      "Joel: Alright, go.\n",
      "Henry: Everyone, upstairs. Let's go!\n",
      "Henry: Damn thing's stuck!\n",
      "Ellie: Gimme a boost! I can get through that window.\n",
      "Henry: Open it from the other side.\n",
      "Joel: Make it fast!\n",
      "Henry: C'mon, Sam, you're not staying in here.\n",
      "Sam: What about you?\n",
      "Henry: I'll be fine. C'mon. Go.\n",
      "Joel: Get ready!\n",
      "Henry: Fuck. Here we go!\n",
      "Ellie: We got it!\n",
      "Joel: Alright, move! Let's go, let's go!\n",
      "Henry: Fresh air...\n",
      "Joel: Oh...\n",
      "Ellie: Wha--\n",
      "Sam: Look at this.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, are you fucking kidding me? Thanks for the warning on the other\n",
      "Joel: So, where's this tower?\n",
      "Henry: We're close. C'mon, let's go. Hey. How you doin', little man?\n",
      "Sam: That was a close one, huh?\n",
      "Henry: Yeah. Not one of our finest moments, but we made it out.\n",
      "Sam: Yeah.\n",
      "Henry: Hey, look at that. Yep, what'd I tell you, huh?\n",
      "Joel: Let's find a way around to it. What about you, how you holdin' up?\n",
      "Ellie: Business as usual, right? When I was with Henry, I took out a couple of\n",
      "Joel: Yeah.\n",
      "Sam: It was pretty intense back there, huh?\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah. Totally.\n",
      "Sam: How'd you two end up together?\n",
      "Ellie: Oh...a friend of mine, Marlene, asked him to take me to the Fireflies.\n",
      "Sam: You seem to get along well.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, well...now I just boss him around. Isn't that right, Joel?\n",
      "Ellie: What was this place like without infected? Tsh...I can't even imagine\n",
      "Sam: \"Will shoot on sight.\" Lots of friendly people lived here.\n",
      "Henry: First few months after the outbreak, they had a lot of lootin'.\n",
      "Joel: Everyone barricaded themselves in their homes, then supplies started\n",
      "Henry: I was just five when the cordyceps hit. My memory's pretty hazy, but I\n",
      "Ellie: What do you remember?\n",
      "Henry: Uhh...barbecues. Parents, they would throw these crazy big barbecues\n",
      "Ellie: Oh. Doggies.\n",
      "Joel: You're gonna want to stay away from those. It's not like it is in the\n",
      "Ellie: What is this?\n",
      "Sam: Oh, this is an ice cream truck.\n",
      "Ellie: An ice cream truck?\n",
      "Sam: Yeah, Henry told me about these. They'd sell ice cream out of the truck.\n",
      "Ellie: What? No way. Joel?\n",
      "Joel: It's true. This thing would drive around and play real loud, creepy\n",
      "Ellie: You're totally fucking with me.\n",
      "Joel: Um-mmm. Serious.\n",
      "Ellie: Man, you lived in a strange time.\n",
      "Sam: Told you so.\n",
      "Ellie: Agghh...is anybody else hungry?\n",
      "Sam: Yes.\n",
      "Henry: Hey guys -- we break when we get to the radio tower.\n",
      "Sam: Alright.\n",
      "Sam: Darts.\n",
      "Ellie: Right.\n",
      "Henry: Hey, Sam...be careful.\n",
      "Sam: Yeah...okay. Alright, I'll go first. Damn it.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh.\n",
      "Sam: Alright, your turn.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay. Just throw it?\n",
      "Sam: Yeah.\n",
      "Ellie: Boosh, I am a natural.\n",
      "Sam: Luck.\n",
      "Ellie: No it wasn't.\n",
      "Sam: That was luck.\n",
      "Ellie: Alright, get outta here. You're getting cocky. Here we go. Fuck.\n",
      "Sam: Horrible.\n",
      "Ellie: Alright...it's a tie.\n",
      "Sam: No, no, you clearly got destroyed.\n",
      "Ellie: How did I clearly get destroyed? That's practically a tie!\n",
      "Sam: Yeah, okay.\n",
      "Henry: There'll come a day when kids can just be kids again.\n",
      "Joel: Let's go.\n",
      "Henry: Fireflies were here.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, by the looks of it.\n",
      "Sam: How're we gonna find them?\n",
      "Joel: I know a guy. My brother, actually. He was a Firefly. Last I heard he\n",
      "Henry: Sounds like a good plan, man.\n",
      "Ellie: Ah, okay. You guys are killing me with your downer talk. It's joke\n",
      "Sam: What is that?\n",
      "Ellie: Just bear with me. \"You wanna hear a joke about pizza? Never mind, it\n",
      "Sam: I don't get it.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, me neither. \"What did the green grape say to purple grape?\n",
      "Sam: That's so stupid. Alright, I got a joke for you.\n",
      "Ellie: Let's hear it.\n",
      "Sam: Why can't your nose be twelve inches long?\n",
      "Ellie: I don't know, why?\n",
      "Sam: Because...then it would be a foot.\n",
      "Ellie: That's so dumb. I love it.\n",
      "Joel: Oh shit! Get down.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh shit...\n",
      "Henry: Fuckin' sniper... Did you see where it came from?\n",
      "Joel: Somewhere down the street. Alright now...y'all stay here.\n",
      "Ellie: No.\n",
      "Joel: Before you start -- I need you guys to keep him busy. I'm gonna go\n",
      "Ellie: Okay. Hey. Be careful.\n",
      "Joel: Come on, guys... Oh, no, no, no.\n",
      "Hunter: It's those damn tourists from the city.\n",
      "Joel: Come on, Henry.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Thought you could get away from us, huh?\n",
      "Hunter: We're back, motherfucker!\n",
      "Ellie: Shit! Oh, that was so intense!\n",
      "Henry: You alright Sam?\n",
      "Sam: Yeah, I'm okay.\n",
      "Ellie: Thanks, Joel.\n",
      "Henry: Alright. We did it.\n",
      "Ellie: We should move.\n",
      "Sam: Henry!\n",
      "Joel: Shit.\n",
      "Henry: Sam, are you okay?\n",
      "Sam: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\n",
      "Henry: You sure? You seem funny.\n",
      "Ellie: C'mon, c'mon.\n",
      "Henry: Let's move!\n",
      "Joel: Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh god...\n",
      "Ellie: Joel, you're okay.\n",
      "Joel: Still here. Anybody hurt?\n",
      "Sam: Uh-uh.\n",
      "Henry: No, we're good.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, I think it's time we quit this place. C'mon.\n",
      "Henry: Let's go.\n",
      "Henry: Shut the hell up.\n",
      "Joel: Dead serious. It was Tommy's birthday. That's all he wanted to do is\n",
      "Henry: Ah, man. I could die happy if I could just drive one around the block.\n",
      "Joel: It was good. It was real good.\n",
      "Henry: Good? Can you believe this guy? C'mon, man, gimme details. Describe it.\n",
      "Ellie: You know what? You two deserve a little privacy.\n",
      "Henry: No, no, Ellie, Ellie, this isn't just any regular motorcycle, okay? You\n",
      "Ellie: Oh yeah? How would you know?\n",
      "Henry: I've seen it in my dreams... Vroom, vroom, vroom...\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Henry: I don't think anyone from our group's gonna show up.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah.\n",
      "Henry: Worst part about it all -- explaining it to Sam.\n",
      "Ellie: Well, it's safe to say those two have officially bonded. What're you\n",
      "Sam: Taking stock of all the food we found today.\n",
      "Ellie: I see... And how are we doing on canned peaches?\n",
      "Sam: Did Henry send you?\n",
      "Ellie: No. Why would Henry send me?\n",
      "Sam: To make sure I'm not fucking up somehow.\n",
      "Ellie: Psshhh. I'd say we all did pretty good back there -- especially you.\n",
      "Sam: Well...\n",
      "Ellie: Is everything alright?\n",
      "Sam: Everything's fine.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay... Well... Have a good night.\n",
      "Sam: How is it that you're never scared?\n",
      "Ellie: Who says that I'm not?\n",
      "Sam: What're you scared of?\n",
      "Ellie: Let's see...scorpions are pretty creepy. Um...being by myself. I'm\n",
      "Sam: Those things out there. What if the people are still inside? What if\n",
      "Ellie: Okay, first of all, we're a team now. We're gonna help each other out.\n",
      "Sam: Henry says that, \"they've moved on\". That they're with their families.\n",
      "Ellie: I go back and forth. I mean, I'd like to believe it.\n",
      "Sam: But you don't.\n",
      "Ellie: I guess not.\n",
      "Sam: Yeah...me neither.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh...all this serious talk, I almost forgot.\n",
      "Ellie: There. If he doesn't know about it, he can't take it away. Alright, I'm\n",
      "Ellie: Damn. That smells good.\n",
      "Joel: Good morning.\n",
      "Ellie: Where's Sam?\n",
      "Henry: I let him sleep in for once.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh.\n",
      "Henry: Well if you want him to join us, you can go wake his ass up.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Ellie: Sam? Sam!\n",
      "Joel: What the hell?\n",
      "Joel: Shit! He's turnin'!\n",
      "Henry: That's my fucking brother!\n",
      "Ellie: Sam!\n",
      "Joel: Screw it!\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, shit...\n",
      "Joel: Ellie? Ellie, are you alright?\n",
      "Ellie: Uh-huh. Oh my god.\n",
      "Henry: Sam?\n",
      "Ellie: Oh no...\n",
      "Henry: Sam...\n",
      "Joel: Henry. Ellie, stay here. Henry.\n",
      "Henry: Henry, what have you done?\n",
      "Joel: I'm gonna get that gun from you, okay?\n",
      "Henry: Sa...Sa...Sam...\n",
      "Joel: Whoa. Okay, okay, easy.\n",
      "Henry: It's your fault.\n",
      "Joel: This is nobody's fault, Henry.\n",
      "Henry: It's all your fault!\n",
      "Joel: Henry! Henry, no...\n",
      "Ellie: Oh my god.\n",
      "Ellie: Jackson County. That means we're close to Jackson City, right?\n",
      "Joel: Shouldn't be more than a few miles.\n",
      "Ellie: You ready to see your dear old brother?\n",
      "Joel: I'm just ready to get there.\n",
      "Ellie: You nervous?\n",
      "Joel: I don't know what I'm feeling.\n",
      "Ellie: So much for this road.\n",
      "Joel: We just follow the river. It'll lead us straight to Tommy's. C'mon.\n",
      "Ellie: What happened between you two?\n",
      "Joel: What do you mean?\n",
      "Ellie: You and Tommy...you're not together, so clearly something went down.\n",
      "Joel: We just had a bit of a disagreement, that's all.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, here we go...so what was it about?\n",
      "Joel: Tommy saw the world one way, I saw it the other.\n",
      "Ellie: And that's why he joined the Fireflies?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, your friend Marlene promised him hope. That kept him busy for\n",
      "Ellie: How was it, the last time you saw him?\n",
      "Joel: I believe his last words to me were \"I don't ever want to see your god\n",
      "Ellie: Geez. But he's gonna help us?\n",
      "Joel: I suppose we're gonna find out.\n",
      "Ellie: Well, with or without his help, we'll get there.\n",
      "Joel: Let's just keep going.\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa, what's that?\n",
      "Joel: That there is a hydroelectric power plant.\n",
      "Ellie: A...hydra who?\n",
      "Joel: It, uh...uses the river's movement and turns it into electricity.\n",
      "Ellie: How's it do that?\n",
      "Joel: Look. I know what it is, I don't know how it does it.\n",
      "Ellie: Alright...how are we getting across?\n",
      "Ellie: Well, that gets us halfway. If we get the other one up, we'll make it\n",
      "Joel: Alright, Ellie, I need you to--\n",
      "Ellie: I know, step on the fucking pallet.\n",
      "Joel: Go on, give it a spin.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, be careful crossing that thing.\n",
      "Joel: I will.\n",
      "Ellie: Teamwork.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah.\n",
      "Joel: That's too small of a grave.\n",
      "Ellie: I forgot to leave that stupid robot on his grave. What should I do with\n",
      "Joel: Ellie...\n",
      "Ellie: What? I want to talk about it.\n",
      "Joel: No.\n",
      "Ellie: Why not?\n",
      "Joel: How many times do we need to go over this? Things happen...and we move\n",
      "Ellie: It's just--\n",
      "Joel: That's enough.\n",
      "Ellie: You're right. I'm sorry.\n",
      "Joel: Let's get to Tommy's.\n",
      "Ellie: Aughh, I'm so hungry.\n",
      "Joel: I know, I am too.\n",
      "Ellie: Alright, next squirrel I see, I'm totally shooting it.\n",
      "Joel: Let's get past this place, then we can scrounge up some food.\n",
      "Ellie: Well, if I starve, you're responsible.\n",
      "Ellie: Uh...should we head in?\n",
      "Joel: Ah, ain't no way around... Gonna have to cut through the plant.\n",
      "Woman: Don't even think about reaching for your weapon. Tell the girl to drop\n",
      "Joel: Ellie, do as the lady says.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "Woman: Please tell me you're lost.\n",
      "Joel: We didn't know the place was occupied. We're just trying to make our way\n",
      "Woman: Through to where?\n",
      "Voice: They're alright.\n",
      "Woman: What, you know these people?\n",
      "Voice: I know him.\n",
      "Tommy: He's my goddamn brother.\n",
      "Joel: Tommy.\n",
      "Tommy: Holy shit.\n",
      "Joel: How you doin', baby brother?\n",
      "Tommy: Goddamn.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah.\n",
      "Tommy: Let me look at you. You got fucking old.\n",
      "Joel: Easy -- it's gonna happen to you too.\n",
      "Tommy: This is Maria. Be nice to her, she sorta runs things around here.\n",
      "Joel: Ma'am. Thanks for not blowing my head off.\n",
      "Maria: Would've been embarrassing, considering you're my brother-in-law.\n",
      "Tommy: We all gotta get wrangled up at some point.\n",
      "Maria: Ellie, right?\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah.\n",
      "Maria: What brings you through here?\n",
      "Ellie: Uh...it's kind of a long story.\n",
      "Tommy: Why don't we bring 'em inside?\n",
      "Maria: Yeah. You hungry?\n",
      "Ellie: Starving.\n",
      "Maria: False alarm. They're friendlies. We've been dealing with raids. Lot of\n",
      "Tommy: It's been quiet for a few days.\n",
      "Joel: What the hell are you doin' here? I thought I'd find you in Jackson.\n",
      "Tommy: Been trying to bring the plant back to life.\n",
      "Maria: We had it working before, but one of the turbines went south.\n",
      "Tommy: We have electricity, Joel...had. We'll get it running again.\n",
      "Ellie: No way. You guys have horses.\n",
      "Tommy: We got a whole lot of 'em.\n",
      "Man: Hey, Tommy, gimme a hand with this.\n",
      "Tommy: Sorry. I'll be right back.\n",
      "Ellie: Can I?\n",
      "Maria: Yeah, of course. He likes when you pet his ears. You ever ride one?\n",
      "Ellie: I actually have.\n",
      "Joel: When have you ridden a horse?\n",
      "Ellie: Winston, this soldier back in the zone. He gave me lessons.\n",

      "Joel: I'm good.\n",
      "Tommy: You sure? I mean...\n",
      "Joel: I said I'm good.\n",
      "Tommy: Okay. Well, I'll hold onto it for you.\n",

      "Woman: It's a compliment.\n",
      "Joel: It's a pleasure meeting you.\n",
      "Woman: You too.\n",
      "Joel: What do you do for protection?\n",
      "Tommy: The adults take turns guarding the perimeter. We even got an\n",
      "Joel: You still gotta deal with those infected though, right?\n",
      "Tommy: Who doesn't? But that's the world we live in.\n",

      "Tommy: Well, go on then.\n",
      "Joel: She's immune.\n",
      "Tommy: Immune to what? Oh, c'mon.\n",
      "Joel: See, I know...I've seen her breathe enough spores to take down a dozen\n",
      "Tommy: Alright. I'll bite. Why bring her here?\n",
      "Joel: I was supposed to deliver her to the Fireflies... The way I figured it,\n",

      "Joel: But you know where they are. Now I'm not asking for much, Tommy. I just\n",
      "Tommy: What makes you think I'd do this for you?\n",
      "Joel: This isn't for me, Tommy. This is for your damn cause.\n",
      "Tommy: My cause is my family now. You ain't talking about some walk in the\n",
      "Joel: Jesus, boy...have Maria get some of your born again friends to do it.\n",
      "Tommy: They got families too.\n",
      "Joel: Tommy, I need this.\n",
      "Tommy: You want some gear, sure. But I ain't taking that girl off your hands.\n",
      "Joel: This is how you gonna repay me...huh?\n",
      "Tommy: Repay you?\n",
      "Joel: For all those goddamn years I took care of us.\n",
      "Tommy: Took care? That's what you call it? I got nothing but nightmares from\n",
      "Joel: You survived because of me.\n",
      "Tommy: It wasn't worth it.\n",
      "Joel: I bring you the cure for mankind and you wanna play the pissy little\n",

      "Ellie: No.\n",
      "Tommy: Goddamnit. I need to talk to you.\n",
      "Maria: Absolutely not. You tell him to go find somebody else.\n",
      "Tommy: Maria, I can't have this hanging over my head.\n",
      "Maria: Do you have any idea how many men we lost here today?\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, what's that all about? Does that have anything to do with me?\n",
      "Joel: We'll talk about it later.\n",
      "Ellie: Did he tell you where the lab is?\n",
      "Joel: We'll talk about it later.\n",

      "Tommy: She's thankful, you know.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, I know.\n",
      "Tommy: I'll take that girl of yours to the Fireflies. You don't have to worry\n",
      "Joel: It's best this way.\n",
      "Tommy: Maybe some real good will come of this.\n",
      "Joel: I need to talk to Ellie.\n",
      "Tommy: Say again, I didn't hear ya. Joel!\n",
      "Joel: What, what is it?\n",
      "Tommy: That girl of yours, she took one of our horses and rode off.\n",
      "Joel: Damn it. Which way?\n",
      "Tommy: C'mon.\n",
      "Man: I saw her riding on outta here.\n",
      "Tommy: Go back inside. Help the others clean the place up.\n",
      "Man: Okay. Be careful out there.\n",
      "Joel: Easy, easy.\n",
      "Tommy: There.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah.\n",
      "Tommy: See the tracks? C'mon.\n",
      "Tommy: She couldn't have gotten far. We'll find her. Don't worry.\n",
      "Joel: Stubborn kid.\n",
      "Tommy: She usually pull these stunts?\n",
      "Joel: Nothing like this. I don't know what's going on.\n",
      "Tommy: She didn't go down this way. Horse tracks. She went into these woods.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie, what're you thinking? There. More tracks.\n",
      "Tommy: Okay, good.\n",
      "Joel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n",
      "Tommy: I got your back. How many do you see?\n",
      "Joel: Too goddamn many.\n",
      "Tommy: Go around. I'll cover you.\n",
      "Tommy: That's all of 'em.\n",
      "Joel: C'mon. Back to the horses.\n",
      "Joel: Tracks keep going this way. Just hope they didn't get to her.\n",
      "Tommy: Look, by the ranch. That's our horse. She's gotta be there.\n",
      "Joel: Area looks clear.\n",
      "Tommy: Be careful.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie? Ellie?!\n",
      "Ellie: I'm up here.\n",
      "Joel: Jesus Christ.\n",
      "Tommy: I'll keep an eye out. Reckon you guys need to have a chat.\n",
      "Ellie: Is this really all they had to worry about? Boys. Movies. Deciding\n",
      "Joel: Get up, we're leaving. C'mon.\n",
      "Ellie: And if I say no?\n",
      "Joel: Do you even realize what your life means? Huh? Running off like that.\n",
      "Ellie: Well, I guess we're both disappointed with each other then.\n",
      "Joel: What do you want from me?\n",
      "Ellie: Admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time.\n",
      "Joel: Tommy knows this area better than--\n",
      "Ellie: Agh, fuck that.\n",
      "Joel: Well, I'm sorry, I trust him better than I trust myself.\n",
      "Ellie: Stop with the bullshit. What are you so afraid of? That I'm gonna end\n",
      "Joel: How many close calls have we had?\n",
      "Ellie: Well, we seem to be doing alright so far.\n",
      "Joel: And now you'll be doing even better with Tommy.\n",
      "Ellie: I'm not her, you know.\n",
      "Joel: What?\n",
      "Ellie: Maria told me about Sarah. And I--\n",
      "Joel: Ellie. You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.\n",
      "Ellie: I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel, but I have lost people too.\n",
      "Joel: You have no idea what loss is.\n",
      "Ellie: Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me. Everyone fucking\n",
      "Joel: You're right... You're not my daughter, and I sure as hell ain't your\n",
      "Tommy: Get it together. We're not alone.\n",
      "Joel: I got two walking in.\n",
      "Tommy: There's more inside already.\n",
      "Joel: Hang back.\n",
      "Tommy: Watch yourself.\n",
      "Joel: Alright...house is clear.\n",
      "Tommy: Let's get back to the horses.\n",
      "Joel: We're clear.\n",
      "Tommy: You want a hand up?\n",
      "Ellie: I got it. C'mon...\n",
      "Tommy: Easy...easy... Whoa... There she is. Kids'll be watching movies tonight.\n",
      "Joel: Where is this lab of theirs?\n",
      "Tommy: It's all the way out -- University of Eastern Colorado.\n",
      "Joel: Go Big Horns. Ellie, get off your horse, give it on back to Tommy. I'm\n",
      "Tommy: What are you doin'?\n",
      "Joel: Your wife kinda scares me. I don't want her coming after me.\n",
      "Ellie: Sorry for stealing your horse.\n",
      "Tommy: Look, come back to town, let's discuss it at least.\n",
      "Joel: Eh, you know me. My mind's all made up.\n",
      "Joel: University Eastern Colorado. How do I find this lab?\n",
      "Tommy: It's in the science building, looks like a giant mirror, you can't miss\n",
      "Joel: You take care of that wife of yours.\n",
      "Tommy: There's a place for you here, you know.\n",
      "Joel: You good?\n",
      "Ellie: I'm good.\n",
      "Joel: Adios, little brother. C'mon.\n",
      "Ellie: So, let me see if I get it straight. If you mess up your fourth down,\n",
      "Joel: Right, it's called turnover.\n",
      "Ellie: And if you clear the ten yards then you're back at...first down?\n",
      "Joel: First down, that's right.\n",
      "Ellie: Man, it's confusing.\n",
      "Joel: You just gotta play it a couple of times. It'll all make sense.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay. None of these buildings look like a mirror to me.\n",
      "Joel: Well, we'll head to central grounds. Should be able to see most of the\n",
      "Joel: Stay, Callus. What kind of name is Callus anyway?\n",
      "Ellie: Not my fault you forgot to ask Tommy his name.\n",
      "Joel: Callus.\n",
      "Ellie: So, these places...people would live here and just study? Even though\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, study, party, and find themselves. Figure out what they wanted to\n",
      "Ellie: What they wanted to do with their lives.\n",
      "Joel: There was a lookout here.\n",
      "Ellie: That's a good sign.\n",
      "Ellie: That's a giant ram. You guys were like some idol worshippers.\n",
      "Joel: When it came to sports? Hell yeah.\n",
      "Ellie: Ooh...it's getting chilly.\n",
      "Joel: It's that time of year.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, over there. Is that it?\n",
      "Joel: Hmm. It does look like a giant mirror.\n",
      "Ellie: How many people you think are there? Fireflies, I mean.\n",
      "Joel: Reckon it takes quite a crew to run that operation.\n",
      "Ellie: You think there'll be other people my age?\n",
      "Joel: Ahh...I'm not sure.\n",
      "Joel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...what is it, boy?\n",
      "Ellie: Sounds like runners.\n",
      "Joel: Stay with the horse. I'll go check it out.\n",
      "Ellie: Are you sure?\n",
      "Joel: Yes. I don't want him runnin' off. I'll be right back.\n",
      "Joel: Huh, looks like someone jerry-rigged this thing. No juice. I'll see if\n",
      "Joel: And that's that.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, I was thinking...I would've wanted to be an astronaut.\n",
      "Joel: That a fact?\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah. Can you imagine being up there all by yourself? Would've be cool.\n",
      "Joel: Oh...well, when I was a kid I used to want to be a...a singer.\n",
      "Ellie: Shut up.\n",
      "Joel: I'm serious.\n",
      "Ellie: Sing something.\n",
      "Joel: Ah, no.\n",
      "Ellie: Come on. I won't laugh.\n",
      "Joel: I don't think so.\n",
      "Ellie: Joel. Please.\n",
      "Ellie: Aww...are those monkeys?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah, a whole mess of 'em.\n",
      "Ellie: That was kind of awesome.\n",
      "Joel: First time seeing a monkey?\n",
      "Ellie: First time seeing a monkey.\n",
      "Ellie: Should we have seen someone by now?\n",
      "Joel: Uh...maybe these guys like to keep a low profile.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah. Maybe.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, look. Fireflies. Joel, look!\n",
      "Joel: I see it.\n",
      "Ellie: This is good. First sign of Fireflies.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, let's try that gate.\n",
      "Ellie: There it is. This won't budge.\n",
      "Ellie: Watch yourself.\n",
      "Joel: You too. Oh, damn it. Spores.\n",
      "Joel: Shit...\n",
      "Ellie: Joel! Are you OK? What happened in there?\n",
      "Joel: More infected. I'm fine!\n",
      "Ellie: Here, come open the gate.\n",
      "Joel: Alright. Let's try the gate.\n",
      "Ellie: You did it!\n",
      "Joel: Yeah. Come on through. Scootch.\n",
      "Ellie: Those clickers -- you think they were Fireflies?\n",
      "Joel: No...no, I don't think so.\n",
      "Ellie: Why would they have infected so close to the lab?\n",
      "Joel: Bill used them as a form of defense. Maybe they're doing the same.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah...I could see that.\n",
      "Ellie: No guards. No nothing.\n",
      "Joel: Yeah...I'd expect to see someone by now. Let's get inside.\n",
      "Ellie: Have you ever been to one of these?\n",
      "Joel: What? A university?\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah.\n",
      "Joel: No, not as a student at least.\n",
      "Ellie: Why not?\n",
      "Joel: Uhh...I had Sarah when I was pretty young.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh...were you married?\n",
      "Joel: For a while.\n",
      "Ellie: What happened?\n",
      "Joel: Okay.\n",
      "Ellie: Too much?\n",
      "Joel: Too much.\n",
      "Ellie: Are we ever gonna find living Fireflies?\n",
      "Joel: We better.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, what about over there?\n",
      "Joel: Yeah. That looks like a way in.\n",
      "Joel: It's rusted shut. We'll have to find another way.\n",
      "Ellie: Maybe we can get over it.\n",
      "Joel: Whoa. Alright, not what I had in mind, but it'll do.\n",
      "Joel: Alright, we're inside. C'mon, kiddo, gimme your hand. There you go.\n",
      "Ellie: Thanks. Let's look around.\n",
      "Ellie: How will they do it?\n",
      "Joel: Do what?\n",
      "Ellie: Get the cure from me? You think it'll hurt?\n",
      "Joel: No, no. They'll probably just draw some blood ?- it don't hurt.\n",
      "Ellie: I've gotten shots before. They vaccinated us at school. It sucked.\n",
      "Ellie: Hello? Where are they?\n",
      "Ellie: Yoohoo! Fireflies? Cure for mankind over here! Anyone?\n",
      "Joel: Let's keep it down until we figure out what's going on.\n",
      "Ellie: Nothing useful.\n",
      "Joel: Ain't nothin' here but a bunch of medical mumbo-jumbo.\n",
      "Ellie: I don't get it.\n",
      "Joel: Looks like they all just packed up and left in a hurry.\n",
      "Ellie: Maybe not all of 'em.\n",
      "Joel: Stay close.\n",
      "Ellie: There are no bodies. That's good, right?\n",
      "Joel: If we find out where they went.\n",
      "Joel: Shit!\n",
      "Joel: Jesus. Well, at least it ain't clickers.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah. No Fireflies either. Well, maybe in all that research they turned\n",
      "Joel: Just keep searching, we'll find something.\n",
      "Voice: If you're looking for the Fireflies, they've all left.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, no shit.\n",
      "Voice: I'm dead...or I will be soon. Got me some time to reflect.\n",
      "Voice: ...been years that felt like we were!\n",
      "Voice: ...fucking thing was a giant waste of ti--\n",
      "Voice: ...not going to do this anymore...\n",
      "Joel: Come on.\n",
      "Voice: ...looking for the others, they've all returned to Saint Mary's Hospital\n",
      "Ellie: Do you know where that is?\n",
      "Joel: I know the city.\n",
      "Ellie: Is it far?\n",
      "Joel: It ain't close. I mean on horseback--\n",
      "Ellie: What?\n",
      "Ellie: Fireflies?\n",
      "Joel: Get down!\n",
      "Ellie: Who the fuck are these guys?\n",
      "Joel: It don't matter. We know where to go, let's get the hell outta here.\n",
      "Hunter: Got you, asshole.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh shit. Oh man...\n",
      "Ellie: What do you want me to do?\n",
      "Joel: Move...\n",
      "Ellie: What?\n",
      "Joel: Move!\n",
      "Ellie: Oh man...Joel? Oh...\n",
      "Joel: I'm gonna need you to pull.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay. Alright, you ready? One, two, three.\n",
      "Joel: Pull!\n",
      "Joel: Just get to the damn horse.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay. I don't see anyone. Let's go! Joel, how are we doing?\n",
      "Joel: I'm fine...I'm fine.\n",
      "Ellie: Can you handle the window?\n",

      "Ellie: Medicine! Do you have any antibiotics?\n",
      "David: We do. Back at the camp. You're welcome to follow us--\n",
      "Ellie: I'm not following you anywhere. Buddy boy can go get it. He comes back\n",
      "David: You put one right between my eyes.\n",
      "Ellie: That's right.\n",
      "David: Two bottles of penicillin and a syringe. Make it fast. Go on.\n",
      "Ellie: I'll take that rifle.\n",
      "David: Of course.\n",
      "Ellie: Back up.\n",
      "David: He's probably gonna be awhile. You, ah, mind if we take some shelter\n",
      "Ellie: Bring him with us.\n",
      "David: There. You know you really shouldn't be out here all on your own.\n",
      "Ellie: I don't like company.\n",
      "David: I see. What's your name?\n",
      "Ellie: Why?\n",
      "David: Look, I understand it's not easy to trust a couple of strangers.\n",
      "Ellie: We'll see.\n",
      "Ellie: You had another gun?\n",
      "David: Sorry.\n",
      "David: Okay, I'd really like my rifle back now.\n",
      "Ellie: No, you have your pistol.\n",
      "David: I hope you know how to use that thing.\n",
      "Ellie: I've had some practice.\n",

      "Ellie: Okay.\n",
      "David: Make every shot count now.\n",
      "Ellie: I've done this before.\n",
      "David: You weren't kidding. You're a better shot with that thing than I am.\n",
      "Ellie: Agh, c'mon, c'mon.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh shit.\n",
      "David: Nothin' over here. Oh lord, there's a whole lot of 'em comin' at us.\n",

      "David: Follow me. Through here.\n",
      "Ellie: Okay. Do you know where you're going?\n",
      "David: I've never set foot in this place.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh. Great.\n",
      "David: It's clear. This way.\n",
      "Ellie: Right behind you.\n",

      "David: Ah, Lord. I've been lookin' for these boys. Doesn't matter. Grab their\n",
      "Ellie: See anything?\n",
      "David: It's a dead end. How on earth did they use this building?\n",
      "Ellie: So what do we do?\n",
      "David: We hold our ground.\n",
      "Ellie: Is there any other choice?\n",
      "David: We die. Get ready.\n",
      "Ellie: You hear that? They're on the roof!\n",
      "David: I know!\n",
      "David: We're doin' fine, kid.\n",
      "Ellie: It doesn't feel like it.\n",
      "David: Just stay focused. We'll make it. Here come more!\n",
      "Ellie: How many of these things are there?\n",
      "David: I have no idea. Just keep at it.\n",
      "David: That doesn't sound good.\n",
      "Ellie: It's a bloater!\n",
      "David: A what?!\n",
      "Ellie: One of those big fucking guys.\n",
      "David: Hey, kid!\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah?\n",
      "David: You know, I think we did it.\n",
      "Ellie: Like we killed all of 'em?\n",
      "David: Don't sound so disappointed.\n",
      "Ellie: More like disbelief.\n",
      "David: I'll check the bridge.\n",
      "David: Listen.\n",
      "Ellie: No infected.\n",
      "David: No infected. What'd I tell ya? Alright. Let's head on back, check on\n",

      "Ellie: Sure.\n",
      "David: I do. And I can prove it to you. Now, this winter has been especially\n",
      "David: Now don't get upset. It's not your fault. You're just a kid. James,\n",
      "James: No way, David. I'm not gonna let her go.\n",
      "David: Lower the gun. Now give her the medicine.\n",
      "James: The others won't be happy about this.\n",
      "David: Yeah, well, that's not your concern.\n",
      "Ellie: Move the fuck out of the way.\n",
      "David: You won't survive long out there. I can protect you.\n",
      "Ellie: No thanks.\n",
      "Ellie: Let's get outta here. Come on.\n",
      "Ellie: Come on. Okay...\n",
      "Ellie: Joel? Oh... I only managed to get a little bit of food. But...I did get\n",
      "Ellie: Sorry. All done. That's it. You're gonna make it.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, fuck. They tracked me. I'm gonna draw them away from here. I'll come\n",
      "Ellie: Easy... Go... C'mon...\n",
      "Hunter: Are you even sure she's here?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Man, there were horse tracks down the fucking street. She's here.\n",
      "Hunter 3: Hey! I got her! Get your ass ov--\n",
      "Hunter 2: What are you waiting for? Shoot her!\n",
      "Hunter: But David said--\n",

      "Ellie: Go!\n",
      "Hunter 4: There!\n",
      "Hunter 5: Grab her!\n",
      "Hunter 6: Aim for the horse! Don't let her through!\n",

      "Hunter 9: She's getting away!\n",
      "Ellie: Come get me, you fuckers!\n",
      "Hunter 10: Shoot the horse! Shoot the fucking horse!\n",
      "Ellie: Oh man... No... Oh shit. Okay...\n",
      "Hunter: She fell down the hill somewhere. I don't see her though.\n",
      "Hunter 2: She's running for the cabins!\n",
      "Hunter: Are we really killing her? David said he wants her alive.\n",
      "Hunter 2: He doesn't get to make that call. James to me it's the girl from\n",
      "Hunter: Oh shit. I didn't know that was her. Screw David, then. I ain't taking\n",
      "Hunter 2: I just want to finish up and go home. I'm freezing my ass off.\n",
      "Ellie: Nature track... Okay, that should get me out of here. You got this,\n",
      "Ellie: Here we go. I got this. Agh...\n",
      "Ellie: That's the way back. Hang in there, Joel.\n",
      "Hunter: Cover the grounds! Make sure she's not hiding somewhere over here!\n",
      "Ellie: How do I get outta here?\n",
      "Ellie: I don't wanna get trapped in here. Agh, where's the way out?\n",
      "Hunter: She's on this side of the lodge!\n",
      "David: Relax... Keeping you alive here. There you go. There you go.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh...\n",
      "David: How are you feeling?\n",
      "Ellie: Super.\n",
      "David: Here. You should eat. I know you're hungry -- been out for quite some\n",
      "Ellie: What is it?\n",
      "David: It's deer.\n",
      "Ellie: With some human helping on the side?\n",
      "David: No. No, I promise. It's...just the deer meat.\n",
      "Ellie: You're a fucking animal.\n",
      "David: Oh...you're awfully quick to judgment. Considering you and your friend\n",
      "Ellie: They didn't give us a choice.\n",
      "David: And you think we have a choice? Is that it? You kill to survive...and\n",
      "Ellie: So now what? You gonna chop me up into tiny pieces?\n",
      "David: I'd rather not. Please tell me your name.\n",
      "Ellie: You're so full of shit.\n",
      "David: On the contrary, I've been, ah, been quite honest with you. Now I think\n",
      "Ellie: Convince them of what?\n",
      "David: That you can come around. You have heart. You're loyal. And you're\n",
      "Ellie: Oh...\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, fuck...\n",
      "David: You stupid little girl. You are making it very difficult to keep you\n",
      "Ellie: Ellie.\n",
      "David: What?\n",
      "Ellie: Tell them that...Ellie is the little girl that broke your fucking\n",
      "David: How did you put it? Hmm? Tiny pieces? See you in the morning, Ellie.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie? Ellie?! Where the hell are you?\n",
      "Joel: Ellie! Where'd she run off to?\n",
      "Hunter: Oh shit! He's over there!\n",
      "Joel: Shit.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Move it! Don't let him get ya!\n",
      "Hunter: Gotcha, asshole. Finish him off!\n",
      "Hunter 2: Hold him still!\n",
      "Hunter: Oh shit!\n",
      "Hunter: Son of a bitch!\n",
      "Joel: You come with me. Come on...\n",
      "Hunter 2: Let me go. I'll...fuck you up...\n",
      "Hunter 2: What do you want? What the fuck?\n",
      "Joel: You wait here. Now...the girl...is she alive?\n",
      "Hunter: What girl? I don't know no girl.\n",
      "Hunter: Fuck...\n",
      "Joel: Focus right here. Right here. Or I'll pop your goddamn knee off. The\n",
      "Hunter: She's alive. She's David's newest pet.\n",
      "Joel: Where?\n",
      "Hunter: In the town. In the town.\n",
      "Joel: Now you're gonna mark it on the map. And it better be the same exact\n",
      "Hunter: It's right there. You can verify it. Go ask him. Go on. He'll tell ya.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Fuck you, man. He told you what you wanted. I ain't telling you shit.\n",
      "Joel: That's alright. I believe him.\n",
      "Hunter 2: No, wait!\n",
      "James: Wake-y, wake-y. Come on.\n",
      "Ellie: Let go!\n",
      "James: Get--\n",
      "Ellie: Stop!\n",
      "David: I warned you.\n",
      "Ellie: I'm infected! I'm infected!\n",
      "David: Really?\n",
      "Ellie: ...and so are you. Right there. Roll up my sleeve. Look at it!\n",
      "David: I'll play along.\n",
      "Ellie: What'd you say? Everything happens for a reason, right?\n",
      "James: What the hell is that?\n",
      "David: She would've turned by now. It can't be real.\n",
      "James: Looks pretty fucking real to me!\n",
      "Ellie: Okay. Shit. Oh man. What the fuck is wrong with these people?\n",
      "David: Where you going, Ellie? This is my town!\n",
      "Ellie: I need a gun. Okay, I can do this.\n",
      "Hunter: We heard gunshots!\n",
      "David: Infected!\n",
      "Hunter: What?\n",
      "David: The girl. She's infected and she got out.\n",
      "Female Hunter: This is bad, David.\n",
      "David: Alright, I need you to round up everyone who isn't armed and get 'em\n",
      "Female Hunter: Oh my god. I'll take the kids to the shelter.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh fuck.\n",
      "Hunter: Tired of this shit. He's crossed the line this time.\n",
      "Hunter 2: I've been saying this for months.\n",
      "Hunter: We've indulged him enough. This girl killed our men and now she's\n",
      "Hunter 2: Let's clean this mess up...then we can have a town meeting. Put his\n",
      "Ellie: They're everywhere.\n",
      "Hunter: What if she bites someone?\n",
      "Hunter 2: Relax. She's not biting anybody.\n",
      "Hunter: I'm saying we could have a real situation here.\n",
      "Hunter 3: We already have a situation and we're gonna take care of it. Now\n",
      "David: You're easy to track.\n",
      "David: How did you do it?\n",
      "David: That's alright. There's nowhere to go! You want out? You're gonna have\n",
      "Ellie: Ah, you fuck.\n",
      "David: You know, I...I wish you hadn't killed James. He's a good kid -- just\n",
      "Ellie: Creepy piece of shit.\n",
      "David: No? Nothin'? Sure about that? Alright then.\n",
      "David: That was good, kid. It's gonna be alright.\n",
      "David: You know, you keep surprising me. It's a shame you wouldn't come around.\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, go fuck yourself.\n",
      "David: Okay then. Don't say I didn't give you a chance. You know, I love how\n",
      "Ellie: Ah, you crazy fuck.\n",
      "David: It didn't have to be this way, you know. You brought this on yourself.\n",
      "David: Run, little rabbit, run.\n",
      "Hunter: This is pointless. I can't see a thing.\n",
      "Hunter 2: Just keep searching. If she comes through here, we gotta catch her.\n",
      "Hunter: We should be guarding the shelter. We got an infected running around\n",
      "Hunter 2: Look. This kid is deadly and we don't know where she's gonna turn\n",
      "Joel: What is this? Why is Ellie's stuff here?\n",
      "Joel: Oh, Christ. I gotta find her. I gotta find her.\n",
      "Joel: Holy shit. Ellie...\n",
      "David: I knew you had heart. Y'know, it's okay to give up. Ain't no shame in\n",
      "David: You can try beggin'.\n",

      "Ellie: He tried to--\n",
      "Joel: Oh, baby girl... It's okay, it's okay.\n",
      "Ellie: Joel...\n",
      "Joel: It's okay now.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie! Did you hear me?\n",
      "Ellie: No. What?\n",
      "Joel: Look. Hospital. This is where we get off. Let's go, kiddo. Heh. Feel\n",

      "Ellie: So, I'm on this big plane full of people. And everyone is screaming and\n",
      "Joel: Hmpf. Well, you know, dreams are weird.\n",
      "Joel: Look at that. Another city, another abandoned quarantine zone. There's\n",
      "Joel: Maybe we cut through here, huh? Everything all right?\n",
      "Ellie: Yeah, I'm fine.\n",
      "Joel: You just kinda seem extra quiet today.\n",
      "Ellie: Oh, sorry.\n",
      "Joel: No, it's not...it's fine.\n",
      "Joel: Well, we could use that ladder. Here we go.\n",
      "Joel: Ellie. Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: What?\n",
      "Joel: The ladder, c'mon.\n",
      "Ellie: Right... Okay... Oh my god. Whoa.\n",
      "Joel: What is it? Ellie? Ellie!\n",
      "Ellie: Oh...you gotta see this.\n",
      "Joel: What is it? I don't see anything. What the hell is--?\n",
      "Ellie: Are you kidding me? C'mon, hurry up.\n",
      "Joel: What in the Sam Hill?\n",
      "Ellie: Whoa. You see this?\n",
      "Ellie: Shhh...don't scare it.\n",
      "Joel: I won't...I won't...\n",
      "Ellie: What are you doing?\n",
      "Joel: It's alright. C'mere, c'mere. Hurry up, c'mon. Go on.\n",

      "Ellie: Oh man...wow. Look at those things.\n",
      "Joel: So...this everything you were hoping for?\n",
      "Ellie: It's got its ups and downs, but...you can't deny the view though.\n",
      "Joel: We don't have to do this. You know that, right?\n",
      "Ellie: What's the other option?\n",
      "Joel: Go back to Tommy's. Just...be done with this whole damn thing.\n",
      "Ellie: After all we've been though. Everything that I've done. It can't be\n",
      "Joel: Well, I ain't leavin' without ya, so let's go wrap this up.\n",
      "Joel: Well, this place takes me back.\n",
      "Ellie: How so?\n",
      "Joel: It was right after everything went down. I ended up in a triage just like\n",
      "Ellie: Is that after you lost Sarah?\n",
      "Joel: Yes, it was...\n",
      "Ellie: I...can't imagine losing someone you love like that. Losing everything\n",
      "Joel: That's okay, Ellie.\n",
      "Ellie: Hey, Joel. I got somethin' for you. Here. Maria showed me this to me\n",
      "Joel: Well, no matter how hard you try, I guess you can't escape your past. \n",
      "Ellie: This time it's gonna be different. I just know it.\n",
      "Joel: What do you mean?\n",
      "Ellie: They're gonna be there -- the Fireflies, I mean. I'm sure of it.\n",
      "Joel: Oh, shit.\n",
      "Ellie: Holy shit!\n",
      "Joel: Stay quiet.\n",

      "Joel: Stay back.\n",
      "Joel: We killed 'em...I think we got all of 'em.\n",
      "Ellie: I think you're right.\n",
      "Joel: Endure and survive. Alright, you think you can shove that crate down?\n",
