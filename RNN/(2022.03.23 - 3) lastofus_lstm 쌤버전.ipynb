Holding position.\\nJoel: How the hell are you breathin\\' in this stuff?\\nEllie: I wasn\\'t lying to you.\\nGuard 2: Did you spot \\'em?\\nGuard: No, place is empty.\\nGuard 2: Let\\'s find them and get the hell out of here before clickers show up.\\nEllie: Hey, uh, I can\\'t swim.\\nJoel: We\\'ll figure something out.\\nEllie: Hey look, it still works.\\nJoel: There\\'s a ladder. Maybe we can use that.\\nJoel: Get on.\\nEllie: Really?\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: Okay, okay. Ah, be careful.\\nJoel: I gotcha.\\nJoel: I got it. Alright, let\\'s get outta here.\\nEllie: Hey, look, um...about Tess... I don\\'t even know what to--\\nJoel: Here\\'s how this thing\\'s gonna play out. You don\\'t bring up Tess -- ever.\\nEllie: Sure.\\nJoel: Repeat it.\\nEllie: What you say, goes.\\nJoel: Good. Now, there\\'s a town a few miles north of here. There\\'s a fella\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get a move on.\\nJoel: Now there we go... Yeah, it\\'ll be faster to go through here.\\nEllie: Man...\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: Nothing. It\\'s just...I\\'ve never seen anything like this, that\\'s all.\\nJoel: You mean the woods?\\nEllie: Yeah. Never walked through the woods. It\\'s kinda cool.\\nEllie: Why don\\'t you just take me back to Marlene?\\nJoel: If she was up to the task, why\\'d she drop you off on us?\\nEllie: Well, maybe she\\'s better now.\\nJoel: Kid, I don\\'t mean to upset you, but your friend\\'s chances of survival\\nEllie: She\\'s a lot tougher than you think.\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter. \\'Cause I doubt I could get either one of us back into\\nEllie: Whoa. Hey, buddy.\\nJoel: Well, shit.\\nEllie: Should we climb it?\\nJoel: No, wire on top of it. We gotta find a way to go around.\\nEllie: Whoa, look. Fireflies. I mean, real fireflies.\\nJoel: Yeah, I see that.\\nEllie: Sorry, I...I lost myself for a sec.\\nJoel: Here we go.\\nJoel: That you, Bill?\\nEllie: Where do you usually meet him?\\nJoel: Huh? Different places.\\nEllie: You\\'ve never been here, have you?\\nJoel: I know this is where he lives, but...no, I ain\\'t never been here\\nEllie: And that smoke, you think that\\'s him?\\nJoel: Sure as hell better be.\\nEllie: Well, let\\'s go check it out then.\\nJoel: Alright, come on. Down here. Watch your step; it\\'s a good drop.\\nJoel: Are you alright?\\nEllie: I\\'m trying to learn how to whistle.\\nJoel: You don\\'t know how to whistle?\\nEllie: Well does it sound like I know how to whistle?\\nJoel: Oh, shit. It\\'s jammed from the other side.\\nEllie: Here, boost me up.\\nJoel: No, that\\'s not such a good idea.\\nEllie: Well, I can\\'t boost you up. How else are we gonna open it?\\nJoel: Alright. Gimme your foot. Now just open it. Nothing else.\\nEllie: Sure thing.\\nJoel: Careful.\\nEllie: Okay. Ah, let\\'s see. Okay. Ta-da.\\nJoel: Good job.\\nEllie: Thank you. So, let\\'s say we get a car from this buddy of yours. Then\\nJoel: Well, then we go find Tommy.\\nEllie: Marlene said he\\'s your brother.\\nJoel: And more importantly he was a Firefly. He\\'d know where to take you.\\nEllie: Oh, okay.\\nJoel: He lives far from here which is why we need the car.\\nEllie: Hey, look. Gnomes.\\nJoel: Yeah. Those are gnomes.\\nEllie: Man, I had an art book filled with these. I always thought they were\\nJoel: Alright, then.\\nEllie: Oh...look at that.\\nJoel: What, you play this before?\\nEllie: Nah. But I had a friend that knew everything about this game.\\nJoel: Well, I was never a big fan of these things.\\nEllie: I wish I could play it.\\nEllie: \"Mandatory evacuation.\" Evacuate to where?\\nJoel: Where you think? Quarantine zone. See, some places got a head\\'s up\\nEllie: Man, must be hard. Just...leaving all your stuff behind like that.\\nJoel: That ain\\'t the hard part.\\nJoel: Hmm. Yeah, that\\'s Bill\\'s handiwork.\\nEllie: Anybody else live in this town?\\nJoel: Far as I know, it\\'s just him.\\nEllie: Fireflies were everywhere, huh?\\nJoel: Yeah, they were. Hoping to restore the country to what it was.\\nEllie: Well...with a vaccine, maybe they will.\\nJoel: Maybe.\\nJoel: Jesus!\\nEllie: Whoa, Nelly. Wha--? What the hell was that?\\nJoel: That...would be one of Bill\\'s traps.\\nEllie: Your friend a bit paranoid, maybe?\\nJoel: Now that\\'s putting it lightly.\\nEllie: What\\'s the deal with this guy?\\nJoel: Well, he helped us smuggle stuff into the city. He\\'s... He knows how to\\nEllie: Well let\\'s hope we don\\'t blow up trying to find him.\\nJoel: Just watch your step. You\\'ll be fine.\\nEllie: Geez. Bill good with a bow?\\nJoel: I reckon he is.\\nJoel: Hey... Look at that.\\nEllie: Let me use that. I\\'m a pretty good shot with that thing.\\nJoel: How \\'bout we just leave this kind of stuff to me.\\nEllie: Well, we could both be armed. Cover each other.\\nJoel: I don\\'t think so.\\nJoel: Here, we can actually use this. It\\'s all clear, come on up.\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Let\\'s give this baby a whirl.\\nEllie: Oh fuck.\\nJoel: Now, listen. Bill ain\\'t exactly the most stable of individuals. So when\\nEllie: I understand.\\nJoel: We gotta be clear on this. He... He don\\'t take too kindly to strangers.\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Bill\\'s a good guy, he just definitely needs some time warming up to you,\\nJoel: See that wire? Stay underneath it okay? Just keep your head low and\\nEllie: Alright.\\nEllie: You hear that?\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nEllie: Oh, shit, you\\'re gonna go in there?\\nJoel: I wanna see what we can find.\\nEllie: You\\'re gonna find my body when I die from a heart attack.\\nJoel: Don\\'t worry. I got this.\\nEllie: Geez. That thing scared the shit outta me.\\nJoel: Well, while we\\'re here, let\\'s search the place.\\nJoel: C\\'mon, let\\'s get the hell outta here.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Shit. Look at this. Alright, stand back.\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: That\\'s one way to do it.\\nEllie: Oh, shit. Those things are kinda awesome.\\nJoel: Yeah, see that? Get back.\\nJoel: Come on. Just stay close.

I need a car.\\nBill: Well, it is a joke. Joel needs a car. Well, if I had one that works,\\nJoel: By the looks of it, you could stand to lose some of that food.\\nBill: You listen to me, you little shit--\\nEllie: No, fuck you! You handcuffed me--\\nJoel: I need you to shut up. Alright?\\nBill: Whatever favors you think I owe ya, it ain\\'t worth that much.\\nJoel: Actually, Bill, they are.\\nBill: Well, it don\\'t matter \\'cause I don\\'t have a car that works.\\nJoel: But there is one in this town.\\nBill: Parts.

Something else you can annoy me with.\\nEllie: That\\'s awesome.\\nEllie: What happened here? Your fellow hunters do this?\\nJoel: Cute. And no, my money\\'s on the military.\\nEllie: Why would they mow down all these people?\\nJoel: Can\\'t let everyone in.\\nEllie: So they killed them?\\nJoel: And dead people don\\'t get infected. You sacrifice the few to save the\\nEllie: It\\'s kinda shitty.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nEllie: What was that?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know. Ellie, get down.\\nHunter: Where did you learn to shoot?\\nHunter 2: Man, screw you.\\nHunter: You had an entire flock and hit nothing.\\nHunter 2: I\\'m about to hit you.\\nHunter: Wow...yeah, you\\'re really upset. Well if you want some lessons, I\\'m\\nHunter 2: Yeah, whatever.\\nHunter 3: Where the hell are those guys? They\\'re supposed to be here.\\nHunter: They\\'re on the highway shift. Wouldn\\'t be surprised if they caught\\nHunter 3: Spot\\'s a goldmine. Lucky bastards.\\nHunter: See if there\\'s anything you can forage while we wait for them.\\nHunter 3: Ain\\'t nothin\\' here. Let\\'s keep going.\\nHunter: Screw this. I ain\\'t waiting any longer. Let\\'s go see what those\\nHunter 2: They pull this crap every time. I swear to god, if they\\'re holding\\nHunter: Yeah. And you\\'ll do what?\\nHunter 2: You\\'ll see.\\nHunter: Yeah, I will see.\\nEllie: Hey, we can climb the bus right here. Okay, we need to lighten the\\nJoel: What is that?\\nEllie: A joke book. No Pun Intended: Volume Too by Will Livingston.\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep going.\\nEllie: \"What did the Confederate soldiers use to eat off of? Civil ware.\"\\nJoel: Uh-huh.\\nEllie: \"What did they use to drink with? Cups. Dixie cups.\" \"I walked into my\\nJoel: That\\'s awful.\\nEllie: You\\'re awful.\\nJoel: Do you even understand what that means?\\nEllie: Nope. Doesn\\'t matter. Alright, I\\'m done...for now.\\nEllie: That bridge looks pretty far.\\nJoel: We\\'ll get there.\\nEllie: Whoa. It\\'s strange seeing a checkpoint with no soldiers.\\nJoel: This is what most zones look like. This place has been abandoned for a\\nEllie: \"Give us our rations.\" Why wouldn\\'t they give them their food?\\nJoel: Sometimes they ran out. Most times they just held onto it.\\nEllie: That never happened in Boston.\\nJoel: Trust me, it happened all the time.\\nEllie: I hear hunters.\\nJoel: Yeah, me too. Let\\'s keep it down while we\\'re going through this area.\\nHunter: Oh...I\\'m so fucking tired. We were up all night chasing this tourist.\\nHunter 2: Oh, you were part of that? I heard about this.\\nHunter: Yeah, this one chick, she would just not give up. I\\'ve never seen\\nHunter 2: Jesus. Sometimes you gotta earn your keep.\\nHunter: Yeah, I guess. We were about to give up when she started shooting at\\nHunter 2: Damn. Maybe you shoulda kept her. Y\\'know, made her one of us.\\nHunter: No, no way. That girl -- she\\'d a killed us all in our sleep.\\nHunter 3: Bossman says we\\'re getting big enough to expand.\\nHunter 4: New head honcho...same bullshit talk.\\nHunter 3: I don\\'t know. Now that we have enough people watching all the exits,\\nHunter 4: What is that really gonna give us?\\nHunter 3 : I don\\'t know, maybe we find some more gas, get some more generators\\nHunter 4: That shit ain\\'t happening. I\\'ve heard that expansion talk way too\\nHunter 3: How do you know? Maybe things\\'ll be different now.\\nHunter 4: Keep your expectations in check, youngun. You\\'ll live longer.\\nJoel: That was too damn close.\\nEllie: The edge of the universe and back. Endure and survive.\\nJoel: Excuse me?\\nEllie: Savage Starlight. That comic I\\'ve been reading? It\\'s what the hero says\\nJoel: Endure and survive?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Man, look at all these books. I wish I had more room in my backpack.\\nJoel: So you\\'re a reader, huh?\\nEllie: Well, when I\\'m not running away from hunters or infected? Yeah, I read\\nJoel: I get it.\\nEllie: \"A moon rock tastes better than an earthly rock...because it\\'s meteor.\"\\nJoel: Do you even get that?\\nEllie: Of course not. \"I used to be addicted to soap, but I\\'m clean now.\"\\nJoel: Alright, I\\'ve actually never heard that one.\\nEllie: That\\'s it...that\\'s all I got. Now what?\\nEllie: Man, you\\'d gotta be crazy to string up soldiers.\\nJoel: You get people desperate enough, they\\'ll do just about anything.\\nEllie: And the people that rose up...they\\'re the ones we\\'ve been fighting here?\\nJoel: That\\'d be my bet. Let\\'s see where this leads us. Watch yourself on these\\nJoel: Down, down, down, down. There\\'s more of \\'em.\\nHunter: Careful with that plank.\\nHunter 2: Let\\'s get outta here.\\nJoel: Alright. I don\\'t think they saw us.\\nEllie: Whew. There\\'s our bridge. We\\'re a little closer, I think.\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep at it. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: That girl is so skinny. I thought you had plenty of food in your time.\\nJoel: We did. Some just chose to not eat it.\\nEllie: Why the hell not?\\nJoel: For looks.\\nEllie: Pssh. That\\'s stupid.\\nEllie: I think we can use some good ol\\' pun humor. \"3.14% of sailors are pi\\nJoel: 3.14...\\nEllie: \"I stayed up all night wondering where the sun went. Then it dawned on\\nJoel: I get it.\\nEllie: \"What did the mermaid wear to her math class?\"\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: \"An algae bra.\"\\nJoel: Terrible.\\nEllie: \"Why did the scarecrow get a promotion?\"\\nJoel: Alright.\\nEllie: \"Because he was outstanding in his field.\"\\nJoel: That\\'ll do. Put that thing away.\\nEllie: Okay. I\\'m all joked out.\\nJoel: I can\\'t make that jump.\\nEllie: If you get me up there, I can move that plank.\\nJoel: Wait here! Let\\'s see where this goes.\\nJoel: What the hell? Oh, this place is bad.\\nEllie: What the hell was that all about?\\nJoel: Get on. We\\'re cuttin\\' through the hotel.\\nEllie: Um...okay...\\nJoel: Set that plank like they did.\\nEllie: Alright. Now you just need to find a way up.\\nEllie: Oh, this place stinks.\\nJoel: Yeah, wood\\'s all rotten.\\nEllie: Did you go to coffee shops a lot?\\nJoel: I did. All the time.\\nEllie: And what would you get?\\nJoel: Just...just coffee.\\nEllie: Do you think those hunters are gone?\\nJoel: We\\'re about to find out.\\nJoel: It\\'s clear, Ellie. Come on down.\\nEllie: Whoa...this is fancy. Ever stay in a place like this? Before it all\\nJoel: No...no, this is too rich for my blood.\\nEllie: Oh. I bet it was nice. I bet we can get up there.\\nJoel: No, it\\'s too high. Let\\'s see what we can find.\\nJoel: Ahhh, I really miss coffee.\\nEllie: Oh, I\\'ll be checking in for one night and I\\'d like your finest suite\\nJoel: The hell are you doin\\'?\\nEllie: Why yes, you can take my luggage upstairs.\\nJoel: You are a weird kid.\\nJoel: Come on up. Watch your step.\\nEllie: Okay, it\\'s time to lighten the mood. \"I tried to catch some fog earlier.\\nJoel: Left?\\nEllie: Yeah. That\\'s awesome. \"What does a pirate say while eating sushi?\"\\nJoel: I don\\'t know, what?\\nEllie: \"Ahoy! Pass me some soy!\" I don\\'t get it. \"People are making up\\nJoel: Oh shit. Get down, get down.\\nHunter: Grr, this tourist put up a hell of a fight. It took two of us to put\\nHunter 2: Wait, how many is that now?\\nHunter: Hmm, five just this week. But hey, I\\'m not complaining.\\nHunter 2: I bet you\\'re not. We done here?\\nHunter: We got another floor to check, man.\\nHunter 2: Check for what? I ain\\'t seen a clicker in weeks.\\nHunter: That\\'s \\'cause we\\'re thorough. We\\'re gonna keep being thorough. Now\\nHunter 2: Alright, whatever.\\nHunter 3: Hey, how \\'bout we take a little food break?\\nHunter 4: Nah, maybe in like an hour or so. We can eat something before heading\\nHunter 3: Sounds good.\\nHunter 4: Got some extra dried fruit if you want.\\nHunter 3: I\\'ll take you up on that.\\nEllie: Oh, creepy. Guess they took the easy way out, huh?\\nJoel: It ain\\'t easy -- for many it was better than letting a clicker or hunter\\nJoel: Let\\'s see where this goes.\\nEllie: Just in case.\\nJoel: It\\'s gonna be a tight fit, but come on.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: You find something to climb on. Okay, here we go.\\nEllie: Alright...\\nJoel: Here we go.\\nEllie: Oh shit! Joel! Joel!\\nJoel: I\\'m alright! Are you okay?\\nEllie: No! You scared the shit outta me! I\\'m...I\\'m gonna climb down there,\\nJoel: No! Stay up there. I\\'ll make my way up to you!\\nEllie: Don\\'t do anything stupid!\\nJoel: I\\'ll try.\\nJoel: Maybe that way. That could be it.\\nJoel: Goddamnit. I don\\'t think I tried over there yet.\\nJoel: Over there. I need to find a way around this gate. Well, maybe that\\nJoel: Oh shit.\\nJoel: I hate these things.\\nJoel: Goddammit!\\nJoel: Made it. Ah, so much for that. I gotta find Ellie.\\nHunter: It\\'s down. Finish it!\\nHunter 2: I got it.\\nHunter: Nicely done. You bit?\\nHunter 2: Not today. You?\\nHunter: Not today. Alright...spread out and make sure we didn\\'t miss any more\\nEllie: Man...I shot the hell outta that guy, huh?\\nJoel: Yeah, you sure did.\\nEllie: I feel sick.\\nJoel: Why didn\\'t you just hang back like I told you to?\\nEllie: Well, you\\'re glad I didn\\'t, right?\\nJoel: I\\'m glad I didn\\'t get my head blown off by a goddamn kid.\\nEllie: You know what? No. How about \"Hey, Ellie. I know it wasn\\'t easy, but it\\nJoel: We gotta get going.\\nEllie: Lead the way.\\nJoel: We need to get back out. Find that bridge.\\nEllie: Just tell me where to go.\\nJoel: I hate this crap.\\nEllie: Wow, look at that.\\nJoel: That\\'s a backdrop. People would take their pictures in front of it.\\nEllie: Yeah, I know what it is.\\nJoel: Okay, then. Something on your mind, Ellie?\\nEllie: I wasn\\'t trying to disobey you back there. You were taking a really\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter what you thought. I need you to listen to me.\\nEllie: I do. It\\'s just that... Whatever, Joel.\\nJoel: That door looks like a way out. Hey, you see a way to get up there?\\nEllie: Nope.\\nJoel: Might be able to get through with this. Alright... Goddamn, this is\\nEllie: You sure you can trust me with that?\\nJoel: Ellie... Push.\\nEllie: I am.\\nJoel: Push harder!\\nEllie: There. How\\'s that?\\nJoel: Let\\'s go.\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nHunter: They haven\\'t gotten back yet. What the hell\\'s taking them so long?\\nHunter 2: I don\\'t know. They went to check on \\'em. For now, we wait.\\nJoel: C\\'mere, keep your head down. Alright now...I\\'m gonna jump down there and\\nEllie: What about me?\\nJoel: You stay here.\\nEllie: This is so stupid. We\\'d have more of a fucking chance if you\\'d let me\\nJoel: I am.\\nJoel: Now you seem to know your way around a gun. You reckon you can handle\\nEllie: Well, uh, I sorta shot a rifle before...but it was a rats.\\nJoel: Rats?\\nEllie: With BBs.\\nJoel: Well, it\\'s the same basic concept. Lift it up. Alright now, you\\'re gonna\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Go ahead and pull the bolt back. Grab it right there. Just tug it. There\\nEllie: I got this.\\nJoel: Alright. And just so we\\'re clear about back there...it was either him or\\nEllie: You\\'re welcome.\\nHunter: Asshole should\\'ve known better. If you\\'re gonna steal, you better make\\nHunter 2: Right? I would\\'ve done--\\nHunter 3: They\\'re all dead! They\\'re all fucking dead!\\nHunter: The hell\\'s he yappin\\' about? Take a breath. Who\\'s dead?\\nHunter 3: The whole crew. The 76 lookout guys. Some fuckin\\' tourist killed \\'em,\\nHunter: Shit. Have you talked to the boss?\\nHunter 3: Yeah. He wants everyone to hold their ground, watch the gate.\\nHunter 2: Alright, you heard him. Search the area. Do not let anybody through!\\nHunter 4: He\\'s gotta be wrong.\\nHunter 5: About the crew being dead?\\nHunter 4: I don\\'t see some tourists taking out the entire crew.\\nHunter 5: What if they did? Maybe it\\'s the military coming back.\\nHunter 4: Don\\'t be an idiot. Military doesn\\'t give a damn about this place.\\nHunter 5: We\\'ll find them. We always do.\\nHunter 4: I hope you\\'re right.\\nJoel: Alright, come on down.\\nEllie: How\\'d I do?\\nJoel: How \\'bout something a...little more your size.\\nJoel: It\\'s for emergencies only.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Now, the safety\\'s on. Do you know how to switch it off?\\nEllie: I do.\\nJoel: Okay, you just...you gotta respect it. This is not--\\nEllie: Joel, I\\'ll be careful.\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Whoa, nelly. Harsh punishment.\\nJoel: Shit. It ain\\'t that much different from what the military does back in\\nEllie: I guess not.\\nJoel: Alright, do your thing, Ellie.\\nEllie: On it. Come on. Stupid chain is stuck. Hold on.\\nJoel: I am.\\nEllie: There.\\nJoel: That\\'s good thinkin\\'.\\nEllie: How \\'bout you get me up there?\\nJoel: Help me open this.\\nEllie: Here.\\nJoel: I got it.\\nVoice: Run!\\nJoel: Oh shit, get down, get down.\\nVoice: Keep running!\\nEllie: What do we do?\\nJoel: Nothing.\\nDying Woman: No...\\nHunter: Busy couple a days, huh?\\nHunter 2: Whatever, man. Damn. No food, old pair of shoes. They got nothin\\'.\\nHunter: Alright.\\nEllie: Oh man...\\nJoel: There ain\\'t nothin\\' we coulda done.\\nEllie: I know...it\\'s just...oh man.\\nJoel: Let\\'s just get to that bridge.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nHunter: Well, at least they finally killed that couple. I was sure they made\\nHunter 2: There better\\'ve been an army in that truck. How the fuck did they\\nHunter: Let\\'s keep searching. I wanna wrap this up by sundown.\\nHunter: Got word from the east side crew -- they ain\\'t seen shit.\\nHunter 2: What about Market Street?\\nHunter: Yeah, they\\'re driving through that area now. Who knows, maybe they\\'ll\\nHunter 2: I pray to god these tourists show their faces.\\nHunter: Fuck, they gotta show up somewhere...I think this\\'ll be your lucky day.\\nEllie: Joel, there\\'s a guy up on that second floor, right there.\\nJoel: Yeah, I see him. Stay low.\\nEllie: Oh man. Endure and survive.\\nJoel: What? Oh, right...the comic book thing.\\nEllie: Geez. I guess this is how it ended for this zone.\\nJoel: Well, every battle\\'s got a losing side.\\nEllie: What if they had families?\\nJoel: Everyone has a family. Best not to dwell on it.\\nEllie: How can you not? Hey -- get me up there. Come on.\\nJoel: There ya go.\\nJoel: We\\'re almost there.\\nEllie: I stayed at a place like this. Back in the Boston QZ.\\nJoel: \"Military Preparatory School\".\\nEllie: Yeah, nice way of saying orphanage. I wonder what happened to all these\\nJoel: This place has been out for a good stretch. They ain\\'t kids no more.\\nEllie: Meaning they\\'re either hunters trying to kill us, or they\\'re dead.\\nJoel: Or they got away.\\nEllie: But you don\\'t believe that?\\nJoel: I believe in getting out of this city. Come on.\\nEllie: There\\'s another one.\\nEllie: These posters are everywhere.\\nJoel: I saw this right before the outbreak.\\nEllie: You did? Did he totally gut her by the end?\\nJoel: Nobody gets gutted. It\\'s a dumb teen movie.\\nEllie: Who dragged you to see it then?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know. Let\\'s just stay focused, alright?\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get through the alley.\\nEllie: Agh, it\\'s that fucking truck.\\nJoel: It\\'s alright, keep your head down.\\nHunter: Six.\\nHunter 2: Nope.\\nHunter: Seven.\\nHunter 2: Not even close.\\nHunter: Ten.\\nHunter 2: Keep going.\\nHunter: I don\\'t know, twenty.\\nHunter 2: Try twenty-five.\\nHunter: Bullshit.\\nHunter 2: Swear to god.\\nHunter: You have twenty-five cans of bacon?\\nHunter 2: Well, twenty-four. I just finished one.\\nHunter: How the hell do you have twenty-four cans of bacon?\\nHunter 2: Military locker in the hotel, from back in the day. Me and Reuben\\nHunter: And that shit\\'s still good? When are you making some more?\\nHunter 2: Why?\\nHunter: Why do you think? I want some.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, I bet you do.\\nHunter: Man...I saved your ass from that clicker last week.\\nHunter 2: I\\'ll think about it.\\nHunter: I shoulda let your ass die back there.\\nHunter 2: Oh, Jesus. I\\'ll make you some if you quit bringing that up.\\nHunter: It better be as good as you say it is.\\nHunter 2: It\\'s bacon; of course it\\'s good.\\nEllie: What the fuck are they shooting at us with?\\nJoel: I think we lost \\'em.\\nEllie: Oh shit.\\nJoel: We\\'re okay. They can\\'t see us.\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nMan: What the fuck?\\nJoel: Sonofa--\\nEllie: Joel.\\nMan: Wait. Wait!\\nEllie: Joel, stop! Look.\\nMan: Leave him alone.\\nJoel: Easy, on. Just take it easy.\\nMan: It\\'s alright. They\\'re not the bad guys. Lower the gun. Man, you hit hard.\\nJoel: Yeah, well, I was trying to kill you.\\nMan: Yeah, I thought you were one of them too. Then I saw you. If you haven\\'t\\nKid: You\\'re bleeding.\\nMan: Ah, it\\'s nothing.\\nHenry: I\\'m Henry. This is Sam. I think I caught your name was Joel?\\nEllie: Ellie.\\nJoel: How many are with you?\\nSam: They\\'re all dead.\\nHenry: Hey, we don\\'t know that. There were a bunch of us. Someone had the\\nEllie: We can help each other.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: Safety in numbers and all that.\\nHenry: She\\'s right. We could help each other. We got a hideout not too far\\nJoel: Alright, take us there.\\nHenry: Follow me.\\nSam: Sorry about the whole gun thing.\\nEllie: Don\\'t worry. I would\\'ve probably done the same thing. Where you from?\\nSam: All the way from Hartford.\\nEllie: Really? I heard some bad stuff going on down there.\\nSam: Yeah, the military abandoned the zone. It\\'s why we left. Place probably\\nHenry: We gotta be careful. We\\'re right next to one of their lookout areas. Is\\nEllie: We\\'re not related, we\\'re more like, um...\\nJoel: I promised someone I\\'d look after her.\\nHenry: Yeah, I can appreciate that.\\nHenry: Wait, wait. Everyone be quiet. Get away from the windows.\\nJoel: They\\'re gone.\\nHenry: Man...that fuckin\\' truck. It\\'s been hounding us ever since we got in\\nSam: Nothing.\\nHenry: Get rid of it.\\nSam: My backpack is practically empty.\\nHenry: What\\'s the rule about takin\\' stuff?\\nSam: It weighs like nothing.\\nHenry: The rule -- what is it?\\nSam: We only take what we have to.\\nHenry: That\\'s right. Now come on.\\nJoel: How far is this place?\\nHenry: We\\'re close. Real close.\\nJoel: Shit. Ellie, you watch our back.\\nEllie: Of course.\\nHenry: Sam, stay with her.\\nHunter: What\\'d you find?\\nHunter 2: Nothing... Looks like someone was up there, but they\\'re long gone.\\nHunter: So where are the others?\\nHunter 2: They wanted to give it another once over. Make sure we didn\\'t miss\\nHunter: Alright...keep an eye out over there. I\\'ll check this area.\\nHenry: We did it. Not bad, old timer. Come on, up on this truck. Oh shit,\\nHenry: Through this door.\\nJoel: Are you sure it\\'s safe being so close to them?\\nHenry: I\\'m the only one with the key, man.\\nJoel: And where\\'d you get that?\\nHenry: I killed one of \\'em. He won\\'t miss it now. Everybody through.\\nSam: It\\'s back here. So...how old are you?\\nEllie: Me? Fourteen. How old are you?\\nSam: Ah...the same.\\nHenry: Oh, you\\'re fourteen, huh?\\nSam: I\\'m close.\\nHenry: Alright.\\nSam: I am.\\nHenry: Here we are. Welcome to my office.\\nEllie: How long have you guys been holed up in here?\\nSam: A few days. We found a bit of food, though. Here.\\nHenry: Blueberries. Found a whole stash of \\'em. You want some?\\nJoel: No.\\nHenry: Hey, man, relax. We\\'re safe.\\nJoel: So why haven\\'t you left?\\nHenry: Been waiting for the right opportunity.\\nJoel: And?\\nHenry: Here. Check this out.\\nHenry: Look at these sons of bitches. Everyday they congregate down there,\\nJoel: That could work.\\nHenry: Oh, it\\'ll work. It\\'ll definitely work. Wow...\\nSam: Ready?\\nEllie: Ow.\\nSam: A blueberry hurt you?\\nHenry: It\\'s been awhile since that boy even cracked a smile. She doesn\\'t seem\\nJoel: So where were you headin\\'?\\nHenry: Heard the Fireflies are based out west somewhere. We\\'re gonna join up\\nJoel: Yeah...\\nHenry: Somethin\\' funny?\\nJoel: Just seems like there\\'s a lot of people putting their stock on the\\nHenry: Yeah, maybe there\\'s a reason for that.\\nJoel: So you don\\'t know where they are and you\\'re just gonna drag him across\\nHenry: I tell you what, how about I worry about my brother and you worry about\\nJoel: Easy. We\\'re looking for the Fireflies too.\\nHenry: This is us. There\\'s an abandoned military radio station, just outside\\nJoel: I guess we best rest up then.\\nEllie: He says it\\'s time to go.\\nHenry: Now, we\\'re gonna be moving fast, okay? So no matter what, you stick to\\nSam: Like glue. Got it.\\nHenry: Like glue. Good, good. Alright, y\\'all ready?\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nHenry: Okay. Alright, y\\'all stay close, okay?\\nJoel: You tried this before?\\nHenry: Uh, yeah.\\nJoel: That\\'s comforting.\\nHenry: Relax, old man.\\nJoel: I just hope you know the way.\\nHenry: This way.\\nHenry: Okay, let\\'s try to take them out quietly. Hey, I\\'ll follow your lead.\\nJoel: Alright.\\nHunter: Hey...how you doing?\\nHunter 2: Just trying to keep warm. How\\'s it looking out there?\\nHunter: We put down some infected, but no sign of those tourists.\\nHunter 2: Think they\\'re still in the city?\\nHunter: Yeah, they\\'re still around. Alright...I\\'m gonna do another round.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, you too.\\nHunter: Hey, you hear that? Clicker.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, I hear it, but I don\\'t see shit! Woo! Nailed it! Did you see\\nHunter: Not bad. Hold up, there it is! There!\\nHenry: Yo, Joel, there\\'s a guy on that light up there.\\nJoel: I see \\'em.\\nHenry: Alright, we did it.\\nJoel: Henry, give me a hand with this.\\nHenry: Alright.

Okay...\\nJoel: Go...\\nEllie: Oh, fuck.\\nHunter: Go around to the other side!\\nEllie: Agh. How the fuck do we get outta here?\\nHunter: The hell is going on back there?\\nHunter 2: Sounds like they found \\'em. Spread out. They might come through here.\\nJoel: Alright, let\\'s get underneath it.\\nHunter: Fuckin\\' open it! Go! There! They\\'re running to the bridge! Go, go, go!\\nEllie: Joel!\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nEllie: Oh, fuck.\\nJoel: How many bullets do you have left?\\nEllie: They\\'re gonna kill us.\\nJoel: What other choice do we have?\\nEllie: We jump.\\nJoel: No, it\\'s too high and you can\\'t swim. I\\'ll boost you up, you run past\\nEllie: Oh, shit.\\nJoel: Oh my god.\\nEllie: You\\'ll keep me afloat.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: No time to argue.\\nJoel: Ellie!

He\\'s pissed but he\\'s not gonna do\\nJoel: You sure about that?\\nSam: Stop!\\nEllie: Joel.\\nJoel: He left us to die out there.\\nHenry: No. You had a good chance of making it, and you did. But coming back\\nEllie: He saved me too. We woulda drowned.\\nHenry: It\\'s fine though. I\\'m okay. Y\\'know, for what it\\'s worth, I\\'m really\\nEllie: That was intense. You cool?\\nJoel: Yeah. Let\\'s go find that radio tower.\\nEllie: For a second there, I thought you might shoot him.\\nJoel: Yeah...almost did.\\nEllie: They\\'re alright. I think it\\'s good to have \\'em around.\\nJoel: I think you\\'re right.\\nSam: Um, do you trust him?\\nHenry: Yeah, I do. Hey, don\\'t worry about it. We\\'re fine now, okay?\\nSam: Yeah.\\nHenry: You gotta believe me on this, Sam, alright?\\nSam: Sure.\\nEllie: Hey, maybe we can find something in that boat over there.\\nHenry: Keep your eyes peeled!\\nJoel: Way ahead of you, kid.\\nEllie: Whoa.\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: First time on a boat.\\nJoel: Well, it\\'s a little bit different in the water.\\nEllie: One step at a time.\\nSam: Hey, Ellie. I think we found something!\\nEllie: Let\\'s go see what it is.\\nHenry: Hey, I bet this goes all the way through. Gimme a hand with this.\\nJoel: Alright, same time. Come on.\\nHenry: Let\\'s do it.\\nJoel: Alright, c\\'mon, kids, go.\\nHenry: Alright. Here we go.\\nJoel: You go in.\\nHenry: Okay.\\nHenry: Hey, flashlights out. Sam, stay--\\nSam: Stay close, I know.\\nHenry: Someone\\'s finally learning.\\nEllie: See anything?\\nJoel: Uh-huh. Gotta find a different way.\\nEllie: Joel, we should see what\\'s over here.\\nJoel: It\\'s blocked.\\nEllie: If you can get it open, I can crawl through and clear that door. Oh,\\nEllie: Do you think they\\'ll join us all the way to Tommy\\'s?\\nJoel: Well, I don\\'t know. We\\'re just gonna have to see how everything pans out.\\nHenry: This way. Yeah, looks like there\\'s a path up ahead. Right here.\\nSam: Can we get out this way?\\nSam: Well, I can\\'t swim.\\nEllie: That makes two of us.\\nHenry: Alright, Joel, how do we get across?\\nJoel: Guess we gotta figure somethin\\' out.\\nHenry: Hey, this thing\\'s on some kinda track. Maybe there\\'s a way we can use\\nEllie: Look, a generator.\\nHenry: It\\'s jammed!\\nJoel: Henry, give it a shot!\\nHenry: Alright! Here we go. Yep -- it\\'s working!\\nJoel: I\\'ll go have a look. You keep an eye out.\\nHenry: Joel! You okay?\\nJoel: Yeah! Still in one piece.\\nEllie: Oh -- this thing again.\\nHenry: Oh, there you go. That\\'s smart.\\nEllie: Ahh, I can\\'t wait to get outta this place.\\nJoel: Alright, see if that generator\\'s still got some juice.\\nEllie: Here goes nothin\\'. Alright!\\nSam: Huh. I can\\'t believe that actually worked.\\nHenry: Yeah, don\\'t jinx us.\\nHenry: I gotta say, I\\'m impressed with you two.\\nEllie: Pssh...we\\'re pros at this by now.\\nEllie: Uh...what\\'s up with this?\\nSam: You think there\\'s people inside?\\nHenry: Maybe.\\nEllie: Are we really going in there?\\nJoel: Oh shit.\\nHenry: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\nSam: It\\'s a sound trap.\\nEllie: A what?\\nJoel: It\\'s a sort of alarm.\\nEllie: I don\\'t hear anything.\\nJoel: Someone used to live here. Don\\'t look like that\\'s the case anymore.\\nSam: Who would stay in here?\\nHenry: Well, someone who thought they could keep a place like this safe.\\nJoel: Ugh.\\nEllie: Oh, awesome.\\nJoel: Ellie, don\\'t--\\nEllie: Ah, calm down. Sam, stand by those posts over there. Yeah.\\nSam: Okay.\\nEllie: Ready?\\nSam: Oh, Henry, did you see that?\\nHenry: Let\\'s keep it down, buddy, okay?\\nSam: Yeah. Sorry.\\nEllie: You hear that? Infected.\\nJoel: Shh, shhh. Quiet.\\nHenry: There\\'s three more heading our way!\\nEllie: Well, I guess we know what happened to these people.\\nJoel: Seeing as how there was a clicker, they must\\'ve been gone for awhile.\\nHenry: We keep moving forward. All we can do is hope that there aren\\'t any\\nEllie: Hey. You think that leads out?\\nHenry: Could be. It\\'s too high for a boost. Maybe there\\'s another way to get\\nJoel: Oh shit. Get back!\\nEllie: What?\\nHenry: Sam!\\nSam: Yeah, I\\'m cool.\\nJoel: That was me. I must\\'ve triggered some sort of safety gate or somethin\\'.\\nEllie: So...this is awkward.\\nSam: Yeah, I know. It\\'s like every time--\\nEllie: Clickers!\\nJoel: What?\\nHenry: Hey, this thing isn\\'t budging, man.\\nJoel: Just go, get outta here.\\nHenry: Sam, you stay close to him.\\nEllie: Henry, we gotta fucking move!\\nHenry: You keep him safe!\\nJoel: Go! Shh, shh, shh.\\nJoel: We\\'re gonna be fine.\\nHenry: Yeah, yeah I know.\\nJoel: Alright, come on, kid. See if we can find a way outta here, yeah?\\nHenry: Okay.\\nSam: You did it.\\nJoel: We\\'re gonna keep going. You good?\\nSam: Yeah. I bet there were a lot of them here. People, I mean.\\nJoel: Looks like it.\\nSam: Look at this place. It\\'s like a classroom. Why couldn\\'t they keep it safe?\\nJoel: Son, I wish I knew. God knows they didn\\'t deserve it. You think you can\\nSam: Yeah.\\nJoel: Go ahead.\\nSam: There we go.\\nJoel: Good job, kid.\\nEllie: Fucking thing!\\nSam: Is that Ellie?\\nJoel: C\\'mon.\\nSam: Joel, that\\'s them.\\nHenry: Sam!\\nEllie: Oh thank god. We gotta keep running.\\nHenry: Doorway -- over there! Sam!\\nEllie: Run! There\\'s too many of \\'em!\\nJoel: Ellie! Get away from the door!\\nHenry: Maybe if we push it together.\\nEllie: Sam! He just crawled through!\\nHenry: He what? Sam, what the hell are you doin\\'?\\nSam: Getting us outta here!\\nHenry: Well, hurry up then!\\nJoel: Alright, go.\\nHenry: Everyone, upstairs. Let\\'s go!\\nHenry: Damn thing\\'s stuck!\\nEllie: Gimme a boost! I can get through that window.\\nHenry: Open it from the other side.\\nJoel: Make it fast!\\nHenry: C\\'mon, Sam, you\\'re not staying in here.\\nSam: What about you?\\nHenry: I\\'ll be fine. C\\'mon. Go.\\nJoel: Get ready!\\nHenry: Fuck. Here we go!\\nEllie: We got it!\\nJoel: Alright, move! Let\\'s go, let\\'s go!\\nHenry: Fresh air...\\nJoel: Oh...\\nEllie: Wha--\\nSam: Look at this.\\nEllie: Oh, are you fucking kidding me? Thanks for the warning on the other\\nJoel: So, where\\'s this tower?\\nHenry: We\\'re close. C\\'mon, let\\'s go. Hey. How you doin\\', little man?\\nSam: That was a close one, huh?\\nHenry: Yeah. Not one of our finest moments, but we made it out.\\nSam: Yeah.\\nHenry: Hey, look at that. Yep, what\\'d I tell you, huh?\\nJoel: Let\\'s find a way around to it. What about you, how you holdin\\' up?\\nEllie: Business as usual, right? When I was with Henry, I took out a couple of\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nSam: It was pretty intense back there, huh?\\nEllie: Yeah. Totally.\\nSam: How\\'d you two end up together?\\nEllie: Oh...a friend of mine, Marlene, asked him to take me to the Fireflies.\\nSam: You seem to get along well.\\nEllie: Yeah, well...now I just boss him around. Isn\\'t that right, Joel?\\nEllie: What was this place like without infected? Tsh...I can\\'t even imagine\\nSam: \"Will shoot on sight.\" Lots of friendly people lived here.\\nHenry: First few months after the outbreak, they had a lot of lootin\\'.\\nJoel: Everyone barricaded themselves in their homes, then supplies started\\nHenry: I was just five when the cordyceps hit. My memory\\'s pretty hazy, but I\\nEllie: What do you remember?\\nHenry: Uhh...barbecues. Parents, they would throw these crazy big barbecues\\nEllie: Oh. Doggies.\\nJoel: You\\'re gonna want to stay away from those. It\\'s not like it is in the\\nEllie: What is this?\\nSam: Oh, this is an ice cream truck.\\nEllie: An ice cream truck?\\nSam: Yeah, Henry told me about these. They\\'d sell ice cream out of the truck.\\nEllie: What? No way. Joel?\\nJoel: It\\'s true. This thing would drive around and play real loud, creepy\\nEllie: You\\'re totally fucking with me.\\nJoel: Um-mmm. Serious.\\nEllie: Man, you lived in a strange time.\\nSam: Told you so.\\nEllie: Agghh...is anybody else hungry?\\nSam: Yes.\\nHenry: Hey guys -- we break when we get to the radio tower.\\nSam: Alright.\\nSam: Darts.\\nEllie: Right.\\nHenry: Hey, Sam...be careful.\\nSam: Yeah...okay. Alright, I\\'ll go first. Damn it.\\nEllie: Oh.\\nSam: Alright, your turn.\\nEllie: Okay. Just throw it?\\nSam: Yeah.\\nEllie: Boosh, I am a natural.\\nSam: Luck.\\nEllie: No it wasn\\'t.\\nSam: That was luck.\\nEllie: Alright, get outta here. You\\'re getting cocky. Here we go. Fuck.\\nSam: Horrible.\\nEllie: Alright...it\\'s a tie.\\nSam: No, no, you clearly got destroyed.\\nEllie: How did I clearly get destroyed? That\\'s practically a tie!\\nSam: Yeah, okay.\\nHenry: There\\'ll come a day when kids can just be kids again.\\nJoel: Let\\'s go.\\nHenry: Fireflies were here.\\nJoel: Yeah, by the looks of it.\\nSam: How\\'re we gonna find them?\\nJoel: I know a guy. My brother, actually. He was a Firefly. Last I heard he\\nHenry: Sounds like a good plan, man.\\nEllie: Ah, okay. You guys are killing me with your downer talk. It\\'s joke\\nSam: What is that?\\nEllie: Just bear with me. \"You wanna hear a joke about pizza? Never mind, it\\nSam: I don\\'t get it.\\nEllie: Yeah, me neither. \"What did the green grape say to purple grape?\\nSam: That\\'s so stupid. Alright, I got a joke for you.\\nEllie: Let\\'s hear it.\\nSam: Why can\\'t your nose be twelve inches long?\\nEllie: I don\\'t know, why?\\nSam: Because...then it would be a foot.\\nEllie: That\\'s so dumb. I love it.\\nJoel: Oh shit! Get down.\\nEllie: Oh shit...\\nHenry: Fuckin\\' sniper... Did you see where it came from?\\nJoel: Somewhere down the street. Alright now...y\\'all stay here.\\nEllie: No.\\nJoel: Before you start -- I need you guys to keep him busy. I\\'m gonna go\\nEllie: Okay. Hey. Be careful.\\nJoel: Come on, guys... Oh, no, no, no.\\nHunter: It\\'s those damn tourists from the city.\\nJoel: Come on, Henry.\\nHunter 2: Thought you could get away from us, huh?\\nHunter: We\\'re back, motherfucker!\\nEllie: Shit! Oh, that was so intense!\\nHenry: You alright Sam?\\nSam: Yeah, I\\'m okay.\\nEllie: Thanks, Joel.\\nHenry: Alright. We did it.\\nEllie: We should move.\\nSam: Henry!\\nJoel: Shit.\\nHenry: Sam, are you okay?\\nSam: Yeah. Yeah, I\\'m fine.\\nHenry: You sure? You seem funny.\\nEllie: C\\'mon, c\\'mon.\\nHenry: Let\\'s move!\\nJoel: Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh god...\\nEllie: Joel, you\\'re okay.\\nJoel: Still here. Anybody hurt?\\nSam: Uh-uh.\\nHenry: No, we\\'re good.\\nJoel: Alright, I think it\\'s time we quit this place. C\\'mon.\\nHenry: Let\\'s go.\\nHenry: Shut the hell up.\\nJoel: Dead serious. It was Tommy\\'s birthday. That\\'s all he wanted to do is\\nHenry: Ah, man. I could die happy if I could just drive one around the block.\\nJoel: It was good. It was real good.\\nHenry: Good? Can you believe this guy? C\\'mon, man, gimme details. Describe it.\\nEllie: You know what? You two deserve a little privacy.\\nHenry: No, no, Ellie, Ellie, this isn\\'t just any regular motorcycle, okay? You\\nEllie: Oh yeah? How would you know?\\nHenry: I\\'ve seen it in my dreams... Vroom, vroom, vroom...\\nEllie: Okay.\\nHenry: I don\\'t think anyone from our group\\'s gonna show up.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nHenry: Worst part about it all -- explaining it to Sam.\\nEllie: Well, it\\'s safe to say those two have officially bonded. What\\'re you\\nSam: Taking stock of all the food we found today.\\nEllie: I see... And how are we doing on canned peaches?\\nSam: Did Henry send you?\\nEllie: No. Why would Henry send me?\\nSam: To make sure I\\'m not fucking up somehow.\\nEllie: Psshhh. I\\'d say we all did pretty good back there -- especially you.\\nSam: Well...\\nEllie: Is everything alright?\\nSam: Everything\\'s fine.\\nEllie: Okay... Well... Have a good night.\\nSam: How is it that you\\'re never scared?\\nEllie: Who says that I\\'m not?\\nSam: What\\'re you scared of?\\nEllie: Let\\'s see...scorpions are pretty creepy. Um...being by myself. I\\'m\\nSam: Those things out there. What if the people are still inside? What if\\nEllie: Okay, first of all, we\\'re a team now. We\\'re gonna help each other out.\\nSam: Henry says that, \"they\\'ve moved on\". That they\\'re with their families.\\nEllie: I go back and forth. I mean, I\\'d like to believe it.\\nSam: But you don\\'t.\\nEllie: I guess not.\\nSam: Yeah...me neither.\\nEllie: Oh...all this serious talk, I almost forgot.\\nEllie: There. If he doesn\\'t know about it, he can\\'t take it away. Alright, I\\'m\\nEllie: Damn. That smells good.\\nJoel: Good morning.\\nEllie: Where\\'s Sam?\\nHenry: I let him sleep in for once.\\nEllie: Oh.\\nHenry: Well if you want him to join us, you can go wake his ass up.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nEllie: Sam? Sam!\\nJoel: What the hell?\\nJoel: Shit! He\\'s turnin\\'!\\nHenry: That\\'s my fucking brother!\\nEllie: Sam!\\nJoel: Screw it!\\nEllie: Oh, shit...\\nJoel: Ellie? Ellie, are you alright?\\nEllie: Uh-huh. Oh my god.\\nHenry: Sam?\\nEllie: Oh no...\\nHenry: Sam...\\nJoel: Henry. Ellie, stay here. Henry.\\nHenry: Henry, what have you done?\\nJoel: I\\'m gonna get that gun from you, okay?\\nHenry: Sa...Sa...Sam...\\nJoel: Whoa. Okay, okay, easy.\\nHenry: It\\'s your fault.\\nJoel: This is nobody\\'s fault, Henry.\\nHenry: It\\'s all your fault!\\nJoel: Henry! Henry, no...\\nEllie: Oh my god.\\nEllie: Jackson County. That means we\\'re close to Jackson City, right?\\nJoel: Shouldn\\'t be more than a few miles.\\nEllie: You ready to see your dear old brother?\\nJoel: I\\'m just ready to get there.\\nEllie: You nervous?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know what I\\'m feeling.\\nEllie: So much for this road.\\nJoel: We just follow the river. It\\'ll lead us straight to Tommy\\'s. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: What happened between you two?\\nJoel: What do you mean?\\nEllie: You and Tommy...you\\'re not together, so clearly something went down.\\nJoel: We just had a bit of a disagreement, that\\'s all.\\nEllie: Oh, here we go...so what was it about?\\nJoel: Tommy saw the world one way, I saw it the other.\\nEllie: And that\\'s why he joined the Fireflies?\\nJoel: Yeah, your friend Marlene promised him hope. That kept him busy for\\nEllie: How was it, the last time you saw him?\\nJoel: I believe his last words to me were \"I don\\'t ever want to see your god\\nEllie: Geez. But he\\'s gonna help us?\\nJoel: I suppose we\\'re gonna find out.\\nEllie: Well, with or without his help, we\\'ll get there.\\nJoel: Let\\'s just keep going.\\nEllie: Whoa, what\\'s that?\\nJoel: That there is a hydroelectric power plant.\\nEllie: A...hydra who?\\nJoel: It, uh...uses the river\\'s movement and turns it into electricity.\\nEllie: How\\'s it do that?\\nJoel: Look. I know what it is, I don\\'t know how it does it.\\nEllie: Alright...how are we getting across?\\nEllie: Well, that gets us halfway. If we get the other one up, we\\'ll make it\\nJoel: Alright, Ellie, I need you to--\\nEllie: I know, step on the fucking pallet.\\nJoel: Go on, give it a spin.\\nEllie: Hey, be careful crossing that thing.\\nJoel: I will.\\nEllie: Teamwork.\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: That\\'s too small of a grave.\\nEllie: I forgot to leave that stupid robot on his grave. What should I do with\\nJoel: Ellie...\\nEllie: What? I want to talk about it.\\nJoel: No.\\nEllie: Why not?\\nJoel: How many times do we need to go over this? Things happen...and we move\\nEllie: It\\'s just--\\nJoel: That\\'s enough.\\nEllie: You\\'re right. I\\'m sorry.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get to Tommy\\'s.\\nEllie: Aughh, I\\'m so hungry.\\nJoel: I know, I am too.\\nEllie: Alright, next squirrel I see, I\\'m totally shooting it.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get past this place, then we can scrounge up some food.\\nEllie: Well, if I starve, you\\'re responsible.\\nEllie: Uh...should we head in?\\nJoel: Ah, ain\\'t no way around... Gonna have to cut through the plant.\\nWoman: Don\\'t even think about reaching for your weapon. Tell the girl to drop\\nJoel: Ellie, do as the lady says.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nWoman: Please tell me you\\'re lost.\\nJoel: We didn\\'t know the place was occupied. We\\'re just trying to make our way\\nWoman: Through to where?\\nVoice: They\\'re alright.\\nWoman: What, you know these people?\\nVoice: I know him.\\nTommy: He\\'s my goddamn brother.\\nJoel: Tommy.\\nTommy: Holy shit.\\nJoel: How you doin\\', baby brother?\\nTommy: Goddamn.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nTommy: Let me look at you. You got fucking old.\\nJoel: Easy -- it\\'s gonna happen to you too.\\nTommy: This is Maria. Be nice to her, she sorta runs things around here.\\nJoel: Ma\\'am. Thanks for not blowing my head off.\\nMaria: Would\\'ve been embarrassing, considering you\\'re my brother-in-law.\\nTommy: We all gotta get wrangled up at some point.\\nMaria: Ellie, right?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nMaria: What brings you through here?\\nEllie: Uh...it\\'s kind of a long story.\\nTommy: Why don\\'t we bring \\'em inside?\\nMaria: Yeah. You hungry?\\nEllie: Starving.\\nMaria: False alarm. They\\'re friendlies. We\\'ve been dealing with raids. Lot of\\nTommy: It\\'s been quiet for a few days.\\nJoel: What the hell are you doin\\' here? I thought I\\'d find you in Jackson.\\nTommy: Been trying to bring the plant back to life.\\nMaria: We had it working before, but one of the turbines went south.\\nTommy: We have electricity, Joel...had. We\\'ll get it running again.\\nEllie: No way. You guys have horses.\\nTommy: We got a whole lot of \\'em.\\nMan: Hey, Tommy, gimme a hand with this.\\nTommy: Sorry.

You ever ride one?\\nEllie: I actually have.\\nJoel: When have you ridden a horse?\\nEllie: Winston, this soldier back in the zone. He gave me lessons.\\nMaria: You know, if you want, we can take him riding later.\\nEllie: That\\'d be awesome.\\nTommy: There!\\nMan: Hey thanks, Tommy.\\nTommy: No sweat. All right, let\\'s continue the tour.\\nMaria: Earl?\\nEarl: Yeah?\\nMaria: Why are you here?

We even got an\\nJoel: You still gotta deal with those infected though, right?\\nTommy: Who doesn\\'t? But that\\'s the world we live in.\\nJoel: Well, maybe you don\\'t have to be.\\nTommy: You sound like Marlene.\\nTommy: These two geniuses are gonna bring this plant back to life.\\nMan: We think we got it this time.\\nMan 2: You don\\'t believe us?\\nTommy: I didn\\'t say that.\\nMan: I bet you a million bucks it works.\\nTommy: Sure.

Looks like you\\'re out two million bucks.\\nTommy: Alright, Joel. Let\\'s go talk.\\nJoel: That\\'s quite the crew you got here.\\nTommy: They\\'re good men. This place gives \\'em a second chance. It gives us all\\nJoel: I\\'ve been on quite the adventure, little brother.\\nTommy: I reckon it\\'s got something to do with that girl.\\nJoel: Oh, it\\'s got everything to do with that little girl.\\nTommy: Well, go on then.\\nJoel: She\\'s immune.\\nTommy: Immune to what? Oh, c\\'mon.\\nJoel: See, I know...I\\'ve seen her breathe enough spores to take down a dozen\\nTommy: Alright. I\\'ll bite. Why bring her here?\\nJoel: I was supposed to deliver her to the Fireflies... The way I figured it,\\nTommy: I haven\\'t seen a Firefly in years.\\nJoel: But you know where they are. Now I\\'m not asking for much, Tommy. I just\\nTommy: What makes you think I\\'d do this for you?\\nJoel: This isn\\'t for me, Tommy. This is for your damn cause.\\nTommy: My cause is my family now. You ain\\'t talking about some walk in the\\nJoel: Jesus, boy...have Maria get some of your born again friends to do it.\\nTommy: They got families too.\\nJoel: Tommy, I need this.\\nTommy: You want some gear, sure.

Kids\\'ll be watching movies tonight.\\nJoel: Where is this lab of theirs?\\nTommy: It\\'s all the way out -- University of Eastern Colorado.\\nJoel: Go Big Horns. Ellie, get off your horse, give it on back to Tommy. I\\'m\\nTommy: What are you doin\\'?\\nJoel: Your wife kinda scares me. I don\\'t want her coming after me.\\nEllie: Sorry for stealing your horse.\\nTommy: Look, come back to town, let\\'s discuss it at least.\\nJoel: Eh, you know me. My mind\\'s all made up.\\nJoel: University Eastern Colorado. How do I find this lab?\\nTommy: It\\'s in the science building, looks like a giant mirror, you can\\'t miss\\nJoel: You take care of that wife of yours.\\nTommy: There\\'s a place for you here, you know.\\nJoel: You good?\\nEllie: I\\'m good.\\nJoel: Adios, little brother. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: So, let me see if I get it straight. If you mess up your fourth down,\\nJoel: Right, it\\'s called turnover.\\nEllie: And if you clear the ten yards then you\\'re back at...first down?\\nJoel: First down, that\\'s right.\\nEllie: Man, it\\'s confusing.\\nJoel: You just gotta play it a couple of times. It\\'ll all make sense.\\nEllie: Okay. None of these buildings look like a mirror to me.\\nJoel: Well, we\\'ll head to central grounds. Should be able to see most of the\\nJoel: Stay, Callus. What kind of name is Callus anyway?\\nEllie: Not my fault you forgot to ask Tommy his name.\\nJoel: Callus.\\nEllie: So, these places...people would live here and just study? Even though\\nJoel: Yeah, study, party, and find themselves. Figure out what they wanted to\\nEllie: What they wanted to do with their lives.\\nJoel: There was a lookout here.\\nEllie: That\\'s a good sign.\\nEllie: That\\'s a giant ram. You guys were like some idol worshippers.\\nJoel: When it came to sports? Hell yeah.\\nEllie: Ooh...it\\'s getting chilly.\\nJoel: It\\'s that time of year.\\nEllie: Hey, over there. Is that it?\\nJoel: Hmm. It does look like a giant mirror.\\nEllie: How many people you think are there? Fireflies, I mean.\\nJoel: Reckon it takes quite a crew to run that operation.\\nEllie: You think there\\'ll be other people my age?\\nJoel: Ahh...I\\'m not sure.\\nJoel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...what is it, boy?\\nEllie: Sounds like runners.\\nJoel: Stay with the horse. I\\'ll go check it out.\\nEllie: Are you sure?\\nJoel: Yes. I don\\'t want him runnin\\' off. I\\'ll be right back.\\nJoel: Huh, looks like someone jerry-rigged this thing. No juice. I\\'ll see if\\nJoel: And that\\'s that.\\nEllie: Hey, I was thinking...I would\\'ve wanted to be an astronaut.\\nJoel: That a fact?\\nEllie: Yeah. Can you imagine being up there all by yourself? Would\\'ve be cool.\\nJoel: Oh...well, when I was a kid I used to want to be a...a singer.\\nEllie: Shut up.\\nJoel: I\\'m serious.\\nEllie: Sing something.\\nJoel: Ah, no.\\nEllie: Come on. I won\\'t laugh.\\nJoel: I don\\'t think so.\\nEllie: Joel. Please.\\nEllie: Aww...are those monkeys?\\nJoel: Yeah, a whole mess of \\'em.\\nEllie: That was kind of awesome.\\nJoel: First time seeing a monkey?\\nEllie: First time seeing a monkey.\\nEllie: Should we have seen someone by now?\\nJoel: Uh...maybe these guys like to keep a low profile.\\nEllie: Yeah. Maybe.\\nEllie: Hey, look. Fireflies. Joel, look!\\nJoel: I see it.\\nEllie: This is good. First sign of Fireflies.\\nJoel: Alright, let\\'s try that gate.\\nEllie: There it is. This won\\'t budge.\\nEllie: Watch yourself.\\nJoel: You too. Oh, damn it. Spores.\\nJoel: Shit...\\nEllie: Joel! Are you OK? What happened in there?\\nJoel: More infected. I\\'m fine!\\nEllie: Here, come open the gate.\\nJoel: Alright. Let\\'s try the gate.\\nEllie: You did it!\\nJoel: Yeah. Come on through. Scootch.\\nEllie: Those clickers -- you think they were Fireflies?\\nJoel: No...no, I don\\'t think so.\\nEllie: Why would they have infected so close to the lab?\\nJoel: Bill used them as a form of defense. Maybe they\\'re doing the same.\\nEllie: Yeah...I could see that.\\nEllie: No guards. No nothing.\\nJoel: Yeah...I\\'d expect to see someone by now. Let\\'s get inside.\\nEllie: Have you ever been to one of these?\\nJoel: What? A university?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: No, not as a student at least.\\nEllie: Why not?\\nJoel: Uhh...I had Sarah when I was pretty young.\\nEllie: Oh...were you married?\\nJoel: For a while.\\nEllie: What happened?\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Too much?\\nJoel: Too much.\\nEllie: Are we ever gonna find living Fireflies?\\nJoel: We better.\\nEllie: Hey, what about over there?\\nJoel: Yeah. That looks like a way in.\\nJoel: It\\'s rusted shut. We\\'ll have to find another way.\\nEllie: Maybe we can get over it.\\nJoel: Whoa. Alright, not what I had in mind, but it\\'ll do.\\nJoel: Alright, we\\'re inside. C\\'mon, kiddo, gimme your hand. There you go.\\nEllie: Thanks. Let\\'s look around.\\nEllie: How will they do it?\\nJoel: Do what?\\nEllie: Get the cure from me? You think it\\'ll hurt?\\nJoel: No, no. They\\'ll probably just draw some blood ?- it don\\'t hurt.\\nEllie: I\\'ve gotten shots before. They vaccinated us at school. It sucked.\\nEllie: Hello? Where are they?\\nEllie: Yoohoo! Fireflies? Cure for mankind over here! Anyone?\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep it down until we figure out what\\'s going on.\\nEllie: Nothing useful.\\nJoel: Ain\\'t nothin\\' here but a bunch of medical mumbo-jumbo.\\nEllie: I don\\'t get it.\\nJoel: Looks like they all just packed up and left in a hurry.\\nEllie: Maybe not all of \\'em.\\nJoel: Stay close.\\nEllie: There are no bodies. That\\'s good, right?\\nJoel: If we find out where they went.\\nJoel: Shit!\\nJoel: Jesus. Well, at least it ain\\'t clickers.\\nEllie: Yeah. No Fireflies either. Well, maybe in all that research they turned\\nJoel: Just keep searching, we\\'ll find something.\\nVoice: If you\\'re looking for the Fireflies, they\\'ve all left.\\nEllie: Yeah, no shit.\\nVoice: I\\'m dead...or I will be soon. Got me some time to reflect.\\nVoice: ...been years that felt like we were!\\nVoice: ...fucking thing was a giant waste of ti--\\nVoice: ...not going to do this anymore...\\nJoel: Come on.\\nVoice: ...looking for the others, they\\'ve all returned to Saint Mary\\'s Hospital\\nEllie: Do you know where that is?\\nJoel: I know the city.\\nEllie: Is it far?\\nJoel: It ain\\'t close. I mean on horseback--\\nEllie: What?\\nEllie: Fireflies?\\nJoel: Get down!\\nEllie: Who the fuck are these guys?\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter. We know where to go, let\\'s get the hell outta here.\\nHunter: Got you, asshole.\\nEllie: Oh shit. Oh man...\\nEllie: What do you want me to do?\\nJoel: Move...\\nEllie: What?\\nJoel: Move!\\nEllie: Oh man...Joel? Oh...\\nJoel: I\\'m gonna need you to pull.\\nEllie: Okay. Alright, you ready? One, two, three.\\nJoel: Pull!\\nJoel: Just get to the damn horse.\\nEllie: Okay. I don\\'t see anyone. Let\\'s go! Joel, how are we doing?\\nJoel: I\\'m fine...I\\'m fine.\\nEllie: Can you handle the window?\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nEllie: Jesus. Come on, move!\\nHunter: I see you!\\nEllie: Shit.\\nHunter: Come on, man.\\nEllie: Alright, just stay here. I\\'m gonna flank this asshole.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nHunter: Those were my friends you killed, asshole. Come on out. You want to\\nHunter: You little bitch.\\nJoel: Shit.\\nEllie: Oh man, we gotta get you out of here.\\nJoel: I\\'m okay.\\nEllie: You\\'re not okay, Joel! Now come on! Move it. There\\'s no one here. Hurry.\\nEllie: You\\'re doing good, just keep at it.\\nJoel: I\\'m coming.\\nEllie: Through these double doors. Oh man. Here, lean on me.\\nJoel: No.\\nEllie: Well can you walk?\\nJoel: Yes.\\nEllie: Then fucking walk. Come on. There\\'s the exit. Just a little bit more,\\nJoel: Behind you!\\nEllie: What?\\nJoel: Ellie!\\nHunter: The kid\\'s got a gun! Watch out! Hey!\\nEllie: Stay the fuck back!\\nEllie: Oh shit, oh shit.\\nHunter 2: You little shit!\\nEllie: Joel. Here, stand up. I swear to god, I get you out of this, you are so\\nJoel: You wish.\\nEllie: Wait here. I\\'ll get the door.\\nJoel: Take your time.\\nEllie: Come on. There you go.\\nHunter: What the fuck? Ah, shit!\\nEllie: Come on.\\nJoel: Just...get the horse.\\nEllie: Alright... Can you get on?\\nJoel: Go.\\nEllie: I think we\\'re safe. Joel. Joel.\\nEllie: Ah, shit. Joel -- here. Get up, get up, get up... You gotta tell me\\nEllie: Oh, this won\\'t last very long.\\nEllie: You\\'ll just startle it.\\nEllie: Where\\'d you go? There he is.\\nEllie: Shit, he heard that.\\nEllie: Oh man. How are you still alive?\\nEllie: What is this place? Everything\\'s cool. This place is not creepy at all.\\nEllie: Who\\'s there? Come out!\\nMan: Hello...we just want to talk.\\nEllie: Any sudden moves and I put one right between your eyes. Ditto for\\nDavid: Um, name\\'s David, this here\\'s my friend James. We\\'re from a larger\\nEllie: So am I -- women and children -- all very hungry too.\\nDavid: Well maybe we could, ah, trade you for some of that meat there. What do\\nEllie: Medicine! Do you have any antibiotics?\\nDavid: We do. Back at the camp. You\\'re welcome to follow us--\\nEllie: I\\'m not following you anywhere. Buddy boy can go get it. He comes back\\nDavid: You put one right between my eyes.\\nEllie: That\\'s right.\\nDavid: Two bottles of penicillin and a syringe. Make it fast. Go on.\\nEllie: I\\'ll take that rifle.\\nDavid: Of course.\\nEllie: Back up.\\nDavid: He\\'s probably gonna be awhile. You, ah, mind if we take some shelter\\nEllie: Bring him with us.\\nDavid: There. You know you really shouldn\\'t be out here all on your own.\\nEllie: I don\\'t like company.\\nDavid: I see. What\\'s your name?\\nEllie: Why?\\nDavid: Look, I understand it\\'s not easy to trust a couple of strangers.\\nEllie: We\\'ll see.\\nEllie: You had another gun?\\nDavid: Sorry.\\nDavid: Okay, I\\'d really like my rifle back now.\\nEllie: No, you have your pistol.\\nDavid: I hope you know how to use that thing.\\nEllie: I\\'ve had some practice.\\nDavid: No matter what, we have to keep them out. Let\\'s hope they don\\'t find\\nEllie: Okay.\\nDavid: Make every shot count now.\\nEllie: I\\'ve done this before.\\nDavid: You weren\\'t kidding. You\\'re a better shot with that thing than I am.\\nEllie: Agh, c\\'mon, c\\'mon.\\nEllie: Oh shit.\\nDavid: Nothin\\' over here. Oh lord, there\\'s a whole lot of \\'em comin\\' at us.\\nDavid: Screw it. We\\'re gettin\\' outta this room!\\nDavid: Alright, kid. This way.\\nEllie: Fucking infected.\\nDavid: C\\'mon. I\\'ll block their path. Cover the stairs!\\nDavid: Follow me. Through here.\\nEllie: Okay. Do you know where you\\'re going?\\nDavid: I\\'ve never set foot in this place.\\nEllie: Oh. Great.\\nDavid: It\\'s clear. This way.\\nEllie: Right behind you.\\nDavid: How you holdin\\' up?\\nEllie: You don\\'t need to worry about me.\\nDavid: Alright.

Looks like someone already fought those things and lost.\\nDavid: Ah, Lord. I\\'ve been lookin\\' for these boys. Doesn\\'t matter. Grab their\\nEllie: See anything?\\nDavid: It\\'s a dead end. How on earth did they use this building?\\nEllie: So what do we do?\\nDavid: We hold our ground.\\nEllie: Is there any other choice?\\nDavid: We die. Get ready.\\nEllie: You hear that? They\\'re on the roof!\\nDavid: I know!\\nDavid: We\\'re doin\\' fine, kid.\\nEllie: It doesn\\'t feel like it.\\nDavid: Just stay focused. We\\'ll make it. Here come more!\\nEllie: How many of these things are there?\\nDavid: I have no idea.

What\\'d I tell ya? Alright. Let\\'s head on back, check on\\nDavid: You handled yourself pretty nice back there. Ha, whew, I say we make a\\nEllie: Psshh. We got lucky.\\nDavid: Lucky? No, no...no such thing as luck. No, you see I believe that\\nEllie: Sure.\\nDavid: I do. And I can prove it to you. Now, this winter has been especially\\nDavid: Now don\\'t get upset. It\\'s not your fault. You\\'re just a kid. James,\\nJames: No way, David. I\\'m not gonna let her go.\\nDavid: Lower the gun. Now give her the medicine.\\nJames: The others won\\'t be happy about this.\\nDavid: Yeah, well, that\\'s not your concern.\\nEllie: Move the fuck out of the way.\\nDavid: You won\\'t survive long out there. I can protect you.\\nEllie: No thanks.\\nEllie: Let\\'s get outta here. Come on.\\nEllie: Come on. Okay...\\nEllie: Joel? Oh... I only managed to get a little bit of food. But...I did get\\nEllie: Sorry. All done. That\\'s it. You\\'re gonna make it.\\nEllie: Oh, fuck. They tracked me. I\\'m gonna draw them away from here. I\\'ll come\\nEllie: Easy... Go...

Okay...\\nHunter: She fell down the hill somewhere. I don\\'t see her though.\\nHunter 2: She\\'s running for the cabins!\\nHunter: Are we really killing her? David said he wants her alive.\\nHunter 2: He doesn\\'t get to make that call. James to me it\\'s the girl from\\nHunter: Oh shit. I didn\\'t know that was her. Screw David, then. I ain\\'t taking\\nHunter 2: I just want to finish up and go home. I\\'m freezing my ass off.\\nEllie: Nature track... Okay, that should get me out of here. You got this,\\nEllie: Here we go. I got this. Agh...\\nEllie: That\\'s the way back. Hang in there, Joel.\\nHunter: Cover the grounds! Make sure she\\'s not hiding somewhere over here!\\nEllie: How do I get outta here?\\nEllie: I don\\'t wanna get trapped in here. Agh, where\\'s the way out?\\nHunter: She\\'s on this side of the lodge!\\nDavid: Relax... Keeping you alive here. There you go. There you go.\\nEllie: Oh...\\nDavid: How are you feeling?\\nEllie: Super.\\nDavid: Here. You should eat. I know you\\'re hungry -- been out for quite some\\nEllie: What is it?\\nDavid: It\\'s deer.\\nEllie: With some human helping on the side?\\nDavid: No. No, I promise. It\\'s...just the deer meat.\\nEllie: You\\'re a fucking animal.\\nDavid: Oh...you\\'re awfully quick to judgment. Considering you and your friend\\nEllie: They didn\\'t give us a choice.\\nDavid: And you think we have a choice? Is that it? You kill to survive...and\\nEllie: So now what? You gonna chop me up into tiny pieces?\\nDavid: I\\'d rather not. Please tell me your name.\\nEllie: You\\'re so full of shit.\\nDavid: On the contrary, I\\'ve been, ah, been quite honest with you. Now I think\\nEllie: Convince them of what?\\nDavid: That you can come around. You have heart. You\\'re loyal. And you\\'re\\nEllie: Oh...\\nEllie: Oh, fuck...\\nDavid: You stupid little girl. You are making it very difficult to keep you\\nEllie: Ellie.\\nDavid: What?\\nEllie: Tell them that...Ellie is the little girl that broke your fucking\\nDavid: How did you put it? Hmm? Tiny pieces?

You can verify it. Go ask him. Go on. He\\'ll tell ya.\\nHunter 2: Fuck you, man. He told you what you wanted. I ain\\'t telling you shit.\\nJoel: That\\'s alright. I believe him.\\nHunter 2: No, wait!\\nJames: Wake-y, wake-y. Come on.\\nEllie: Let go!\\nJames: Get--\\nEllie: Stop!\\nDavid: I warned you.\\nEllie: I\\'m infected! I\\'m infected!\\nDavid: Really?\\nEllie: ...and so are you. Right there. Roll up my sleeve. Look at it!\\nDavid: I\\'ll play along.\\nEllie: What\\'d you say? Everything happens for a reason, right?\\nJames: What the hell is that?\\nDavid: She would\\'ve turned by now. It can\\'t be real.\\nJames: Looks pretty fucking real to me!\\nEllie: Okay. Shit. Oh man. What the fuck is wrong with these people?\\nDavid: Where you going, Ellie? This is my town!\\nEllie: I need a gun. Okay, I can do this.\\nHunter: We heard gunshots!\\nDavid: Infected!\\nHunter: What?\\nDavid: The girl. She\\'s infected and she got out.\\nFemale Hunter: This is bad, David.\\nDavid: Alright, I need you to round up everyone who isn\\'t armed and get \\'em\\nFemale Hunter: Oh my god. I\\'ll take the kids to the shelter.\\nEllie: Oh fuck.\\nHunter: Tired of this shit. He\\'s crossed the line this time.\\nHunter 2: I\\'ve been saying this for months.\\nHunter: We\\'ve indulged him enough. This girl killed our men and now she\\'s\\nHunter 2: Let\\'s clean this mess up...then we can have a town meeting. Put his\\nEllie: They\\'re everywhere.\\nHunter: What if she bites someone?\\nHunter 2: Relax. She\\'s not biting anybody.\\nHunter: I\\'m saying we could have a real situation here.\\nHunter 3: We already have a situation and we\\'re gonna take care of it. Now\\nDavid: You\\'re easy to track.\\nDavid: How did you do it?\\nDavid: That\\'s alright. There\\'s nowhere to go! You want out? You\\'re gonna have\\nEllie: Ah, you fuck.\\nDavid: You know, I...I wish you hadn\\'t killed James. He\\'s a good kid -- just\\nEllie: Creepy piece of shit.\\nDavid: No? Nothin\\'? Sure about that? Alright then.\\nDavid: That was good, kid. It\\'s gonna be alright.\\nDavid: You know, you keep surprising me. It\\'s a shame you wouldn\\'t come around.\\nEllie: Yeah, go fuck yourself.\\nDavid: Okay then. Don\\'t say I didn\\'t give you a chance. You know, I love how\\nEllie: Ah, you crazy fuck.\\nDavid: It didn\\'t have to be this way, you know. You brought this on yourself.\\nDavid: Run, little rabbit, run.\\nHunter: This is pointless. I can\\'t see a thing.\\nHunter 2: Just keep searching. If she comes through here, we gotta catch her.\\nHunter: We should be guarding the shelter. We got an infected running around\\nHunter 2: Look. This kid is deadly and we don\\'t know where she\\'s gonna turn\\nJoel: What is this? Why is Ellie\\'s stuff here?\\nJoel: Oh, Christ. I gotta find her. I gotta find her.\\nJoel: Holy shit.

And everyone is screaming and\\nJoel: Hmpf. Well, you know, dreams are weird.\\nJoel: Look at that. Another city, another abandoned quarantine zone. There\\'s\\nJoel: Maybe we cut through here, huh? Everything all right?\\nEllie: Yeah, I\\'m fine.\\nJoel: You just kinda seem extra quiet today.\\nEllie: Oh, sorry.\\nJoel: No, it\\'s not...it\\'s fine.\\nJoel: Well, we could use that ladder.

Look at those things.\\nJoel: So...this everything you were hoping for?\\nEllie: It\\'s got its ups and downs, but...you can\\'t deny the view though.\\nJoel: We don\\'t have to do this. You know that, right?\\nEllie: What\\'s the other option?\\nJoel: Go back to Tommy\\'s. Just...be done with this whole damn thing.\\nEllie: After all we\\'ve been though. Everything that I\\'ve done. It can\\'t be\\nJoel: Well, I ain\\'t leavin\\' without ya, so let\\'s go wrap this up.\\nJoel: Well, this place takes me back.\\nEllie: How so?\\nJoel: It was right after everything went down. I ended up in a triage just like\\nEllie: Is that after you lost Sarah?\\nJoel: Yes, it was...\\nEllie: I...can\\'t imagine losing someone you love like that. Losing everything\\nJoel: That\\'s okay, Ellie.\\nEllie: Hey, Joel. I got somethin\\' for you. Here. Maria showed me this to me\\nJoel: Well, no matter how hard you try, I guess you can\\'t escape your past. \\nEllie: This time it\\'s gonna be different. I just know it.\\nJoel: What do you mean?\\nEllie: They\\'re gonna be there -- the Fireflies, I mean. I\\'m sure of it.\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nEllie: Holy shit!\\nJoel: Stay quiet.\\nEllie: Oh my god. There\\'s so many of them.\\nJoel: I know. Let\\'s just keep it at.\\nJoel: Stay back.\\nJoel: We killed \\'em...I think we got all of \\'em.\\nEllie: I think you\\'re right.\\nJoel: Endure and survive. Alright, you think you can shove that crate down?\\nEllie: No sweat. Okay... Look out below!\\nJoel: Watch your step. That water looks pretty deep.\\nEllie: Hey, that\\'s what we can do once we\\'re done.\\nJoel: What\\'s that?\\nEllie: You can teach me how to swim.\\nJoel: You got it.\\nJoel: I\\'m on the other side!\\nEllie: Cool. Drop that ladder down for me!\\nJoel: Alright, hold on.\\nJoel: Alright, just stick to the edge. It\\'s shallow over here.\\nEllie: Oh, it\\'s freezing!\\nJoel: And another jammed door. Alright. Gimme your foot.\\nEllie: Okay...\\nJoel: C\\'mon. Get that door open.\\nJoel: You okay?\\nEllie: Yeah...it just surprised me. Man, I can\\'t wait for those things to be\\nEllie: Hey, look. There it is.\\nJoel: Just stay put.\\nEllie: I\\'m not goin\\' anywhere.\\nEllie: You made it! Alright, come on, get me across.\\nJoel: Alright, get on.\\nEllie: Okay. Okay, there. I\\'m on it. Be careful.\\nJoel: I gotcha.\\nEllie: Stand back!\\nJoel: Oh shit.\\nEllie: Wha...what just happened?\\nJoel: Damn ladder broke off the wall.\\nEllie: Now what?\\nJoel: I\\'ll figure somethin\\' out.\\nEllie: Oh, I see...good idea.\\nEllie: Oh boy.\\nJoel: Let me go ahead and you follow my lead.\\nEllie: Okay. Right behind you.\\nJoel: Okay. Come on -- jump.\\nEllie: You\\'re gonna catch me?\\nJoel: I got you. See?
